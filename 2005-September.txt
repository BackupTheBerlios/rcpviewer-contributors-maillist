September already :-(
Rev 483 committed.
Reference table a little better behaved (though column resizing using 
net.sf.plugin.util class has a bug that keeps growing the width).
There is now also the first stages of a master/child gui.
Dan - tomorrow I hope to get attribute listeners working - ought they?

Rev 484 committed.
* Added alphabetical sort of fields in editor - can switch to using 
annotations once I learn what they are!
* Removed MasterDetailsBlock and ChildDetailsPage within editors.parts 
package.  They just added complexity for no good reason.
* Added randomising 'configure gui' button - give it a click!

The 'configure gui' button which exists on the CollectionPart only is 
something I wish to make ubiquitous. The idea is to allow the user to 
easily and immediately re-configure an element of the gui to suit their 
needs.  Currently all it does on the CollectionsPart is hide random 
field/columns - but the idea is there.  Ultimately the aim is to 
preserve user settings at a gui element / domain class level.

Such a 'learning UI' (a 'louis'?) would be part of the Essential 
proposition.  A potential weakness of  generic platforms is that they do 
not provide the user with a focussed GUI.  This might go some way to 
ameliorating this.

in TestOrderForAttributes:

		IExtendedDomainClass<?> extendedDomainClass =
			domainClass.getAdapter(IExtendedDomainClass.class);
		List<EAttribute> orderedAttributes =
			extendedDomainClass.orderedAttributes();

which is picking up the @Order annotation, take a look at the classes in
Petstore.

Agreed.  I'd had a similar thought having read somewhere about the Eclipse
API that I suspect you are using.  However, I had expected this feature to
be some way down the track on the todo list ... so, a pleasant surprise.

I mentioned this to one of the contractors I've been working with, he
immediately made a couple of relevant points (which perhaps you've thought
of, I hadn't):
a) you'd want a way to reset if you bugger it up and can't figure out how to
get back
b) you'd want a way to export and import a bunch of settings so that if your
colleague had it set up "just so" then you could easily use them.
Something to put in Windows>Preferences, or wherever?

I like that too.  Make a good theme for an article.  You gonna change your
package names again :-)  I guess it would be org.essentialplatform.louis ?

Message-ID: <LGEELLOAEBMLCOGIKLMKOEIKDEAA.dan@haywood-associates.co.uk>

I haven't done a commit all week, so I thought I'd better do a posting to
the mailing list at least.

Last week I uploaded some transactional aspects; this week I've been doing
the tests for them.  Have about 50 written and about 25 are passing.  Don't
wanna do another commit til I get my green bar back again.

As an update though, I'm starting to understand more concretely the
interactions between transactions, persistence and resolving of persisted
objects, and hopefully what all this stuff will look like once we introduce
a distribution mechanism.  I hope to get the transaction stuff and hopefully
resolving working by 19th Sept deadline.

Mike: special request - could you add some sort of interface in MY
...domain.runtime plugin package, something like:

package de.berlios.rcpviewer.eunit; // eunit = Essential Unit

public interface IFixture {
  // installs a fixture for prototyping or for unit testing
  public void install();
}

and then define an extension point to call such, and then make sure that the
install() method gets called after your bootstrapping is done.  This then
gives me a place to start populating the objectstore with sample data ready
for the movie (hoping I get that far).

Thanks
Dan

No progress yesterday - bogged down in disastrous refactoring of Epic.
Today did pretty stuff as a light relief.
Added icons for all fields indicating type and offering tooltip advice. 
  Ultimately this tooltip advice can be built up from annotations to be 
truly useful but currently just repeats what the icon indicates.  Icons 
are also far too garish and distracting (best that an uncreative type 
such as I can do with Word and Paint!) but I think that when nicely 
drawn, these could be useful.

Other stuff:

Attribute Sort
I have not used the IExtendedDomainClass.orderedAttributes method.
Rather I have copied and extended
de.berlios.rcpviewer.progmodel.extended.AttributeComparator within the
gui project as:
a) I think the model's job is to inform, not to do, so the
getOrderedAttributes functionality should exist in the gui, not
IExtendedDomainClass.
b) References should get ordered to.

Preferences for Gui Config
Probably will not happen to past movie release.

Package Renaming
I'll rename to Louis once we do the big change to essentialplatform.

Next steps:
1. Dan's request for a fixture extension point (I think I have that 
planned into the architecture anyway)

2. The single reference part has not been touched in a while so bring 
into line with the collections part.

3. Stop randomising the gui through the config button but do something 
useful.

You'll have noticed the lack of 'Progress' mails recently.
Have been bogged down in a big refactoring of Epic before an incremental
release scheduled for the end of this week.  Sorry.

Anyhow, have found some time for minor stuff.

Dan - your 'IFixture' request has been granted but it is actually called
de.berlios.rcpviewer.persistence.IObjectStoreBootStrap.  Ok - it is not
actually a bootstrapper but I hey.  Let me know if its what you want
and/or feel free to change.  It is run by an additional bootstrap job on
the GuiPlugin.

errr - that's it.  I still have to do the other stuff I promised.
We are a bit tight on time re: the 17th as Thursday/Friday I'm off in a
shipyard and the following Sunday-Wednesday on a much-needed break
(organised at the last minute hence my lack of warning).

Hopefully there will be enough for the movie.

err ... actually checked in the stuff I talked about yesterday (rev 487)

In addition added first go at user-controlled gui config.  This only 
exists for collections but two things to note so far:
* I have eschewed the normal dialog box for a slimmer, cleaner shell, 
what do you think?
* the table view and the master/child view have independent settings;

In the short time I have been able to allocate to Essential today 
(aargh! Epic's in-memory db could not handle right outer-joins) I have 
been faffing with the one-to-one reference gui.  How should it look - 
anything that resembles the collections gui just wastes space and is 
confusing - but anything else is inconsistent.  And I only have tomorrow 
before Dan's movie...

Dan,

Oh dear - I just remembered the problems you mentioned below and had a 
quick look.

The customer editor is not opening as its Account is not attached to the 
session and the editor (more properly the component ReferencePart) is 
using the session to get the appropriate IDomainObject for the pojo.
Question : I thought all objects I would deal with are in the session..?

The attributes on StockItem are not being displayed coz:
* either they are BigDecimals - I have not FieldBuilder for them yet
* or they are domian-specific value objects which also need field builders.

The field builder thing is not an issue - I just need to create them.
However I have clearly misunderstood regarding objects and sessions.  Help!

Oh - the 'oh dear' at the start is coz there is no chance of my 
rectifying all of this before out 17th deadline, what with impromtu 
holidays and (occasional) real work interfering.

Mike E.

Mike,

You haven't misunderstood the session thing - I haven't coded the Customer
correctly.  That said, I did realize when doing the xactn stuff that the
IPojo.getDomainObject() shouldn't really be delegating to the session -
every IPojo should have an IDomainObject all the time.  So this method now
just returns an instance variable that I introduce.  What was creating the
DomainObject now merely initializes the DomainObject that the IPojo already
holds.

To answer your question though - it was my intention that at some stage we
would be able to detach objects from sessions and attach them to other
sessions.  I suppose you'd want me to say why this would be a good thing?
Yes, quite.  I think it was so one could effectively move objects from one
objectstore to another, like a poor man's data migration tool.  Hardly core
functionality - certainly not essential...

Regards petstore - never mind, I was being too ambitious.  I'll develop a 3
class model for the movie instead that exercises functionality that is
working.

Dan

Good enough for now.  I'm a little ambivalent.  I think as we add further
features it'll either help define our look-n-feel or it'll stick out like a
sore thumb ...

lovely.

What I think I'd like is to see the toString() always shown, that is
alongside the label and icon, left justified with any primitives (eg the
Beans#numBeans field).  If we could then have some way of showing the
details view directly below, in a collapsible region, would be great.

So in other words, move the current field that resides in the 1:1
ReferencePart's collapsible region up to be part of the header of the
collapsible region, and then in its place put in the same
part/builder/editor that you use for the details view of the collection
reference.

If possible :-)

The 19th Sept deadline was to give me a coupla weeks slush.  My hard
deadline is the end of the month.  But I'm gonna start experimenting with
CamStudio this week.

That said, I don't think I'm gonna get much work done in the last 2 weeks,
or indeed through the rest of October.  I'm about to start 6 weeks hard
teaching for a grad training programme I do each year, and the amount of
downtime is rather slim.  So it'll be somewhat of a go-slow for me for the
foreseeable, I'm afraid.  (I can still offer opinions, mind!)

Huzzah!

I've checked in my tests for transaction management, with fixes to the
functionality as per se.  Still some more to do, but only on making sure the
listeners are being fired.

Please make sure you do an svn update to rev 491.

Have added FieldParts and DnD objects for BigDecimal and FilePath, hence 
StockItem petstore editor works nows.
Notes:
- this means that I have added gui stuff to the petstore project - good 
practice for testing my extension mechanisms.  Have found a specific 
problem with DnD, so will have to think about a generic mechanism for 
value objects
- the FilePath stuff does not pay any heed to the FilePath's filters yet
- other projects that have been changed - gui and the 
net.sf.plugins.utils so these'll need updating.

Next will get onto the reference gui part as Dan suggests.  Will also 
make more robust so a failure does not prevent the whole editor opening.

Might get more done later, dependent on Epic testing...

Subject: [Rcpviewer-contributors] xactn commit + File>Save
Message-ID: <LGEELLOAEBMLCOGIKLMKAEKMDEAA.dan@haywood-associates.co.uk>

Hi Mike,
hmmm - I'm thinking we might need that 2 weeks' slush.

I'm seeing some strange behaviour regarding when xactns are committed vs
when File>Save is called, but I think that's probably to be expected cos I
don't think you've made any changes here yet?  Can you arrange it such that
File>Save will do the following:

ITransaction xactn =
TransactaionManager.instance().getCurrentTransactionFor(pojoInFocus, false);
if (xactn != null) {
   xactn.commit();
}

To determine whether any given pojo is dirty (annotated with a *), need to
listen on the TransactoinManager for whether it has been enlisted in an
xactn or not.  That's the theory - though its the listening stuff that I
haven't completely tested yet, so I might be fibbing.  Note that committing
a xactn that has >1 pojo enlisted will effectively "save" them both.


---
The other thing I want to get going is the Customer#placeOrder (in
examples/workspace/demo).  Right now this isn't working at all, in that the
UI isn't updated.  I suspect the problem is mine completely: the newly
created Order isn't shown in either the Session view or the Customer's
collection.  but if you have any insights, please let me know... :-(

Enough already.

Dan

Subject: [Rcpviewer-contributors] movie uploaded to wiki website
Message-ID: <LGEELLOAEBMLCOGIKLMKGEKPDEAA.dan@haywood-associates.co.uk>

... well, a first cut one at any rate.  Will redo when we get some nice
icons; I also want to show how to build up the app from File>New Project -
should be that much more impressive.  However, worried about the size: 8Mb
for 2minutes footage can't be right, can it?

The page that has the movie is
http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/start/movie.

In the course of doing this, had to do some (partial) fixes to the gui
(louis?) to get the movie even semi okay.  We need to figure out how to tie
up the isDirty cycle of ManagedForm with transactions; specifically (as I've
said) adding a listener on ITranasctionManager and ITransaction.  I hacked
it for now.

Also, have extended IFieldListener so that it creates the attribute change
on focusLost.  This works for strings but nothing else, as I say I was
hacking.  Also, I commented out a guard on _field.getGuiValue() regarding
something being null; that might need reinstating, but it was stopping
anything getting saved at all.  At any rate, check out REVIEW_ME for some of
these changes (rev 498).

Message-ID: <LGEELLOAEBMLCOGIKLMKGELDDEAA.dan@haywood-associates.co.uk>

I just re-discovered Wink (http://www.debugmode.com/wink/, so have re-worked
the movie (previously in AVI format) as a much more compact Flash movie.  As
well as demonstrating more features, it is also annotated to explain what's
going on.

Check it out on the wiki at

It's good - I think the proposition we're offering could become quite 
cool.  I'll feel all inspired ... next Wednesday.
Got back last night, final post-break-in flat cleaning this morning, and 
now off on holiday.
So alas no work from me until then.
Hope your travails do not get worse before then.
Apologies for the bad timing.

Subject: [Rcpviewer-contributors] Xactn listener tests committed
Message-ID: <LGEELLOAEBMLCOGIKLMKEEMIDEAA.dan@haywood-associates.co.uk>

Turned out that no fixes were needed to the code itself, but it's good to
have some tests that prove its working as designed.

So that more-or-less finishes off the xactn stuff for now.  The only
functionality I've left untested is the reverse/reapply stuff.

That said, I anticipate some changes once I start sending these xactns over
the wire and start replaying them server-side.  There will probably need to
be some sort of decoupling of the change sets vs the transaction context.
One thing at a time, though.

Fine by me.
It would be a good time to change package names etc, especially as I am, 
ahem, revamping, the GUI stuff (see progress mail to come).

These progress mails are getting rarer eh?
Alas this is likely to be the case for over the next quarter as various 
trips and incremental priorities take over.

However, undaunted, I continue...
Have been getting a little dismayed at how ugly the GUI code is becoming 
  so, rather like Stephen Hawking, I'm currently looking for a Unified 
Architecture.  Getting there slowly - hope to have something to show 
shortly.  Dan I realise this is totally inappropriate regarding your 
movie but to get the things you wanted I found myself getting into more 
and more convoluted ugliness.  Hence the rewrite (and, naturally package 
changes).

Slap me when lack of visible progress starts hurting.

Mike E.

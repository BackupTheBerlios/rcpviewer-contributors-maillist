<PRE>The current transaction view is coming on.

Now (appear to) have undo/redo going for references and collections as well
as for attributes.  I've also put the executed (undoable) changes on the
RHS, with the undone (redoable) changes on the LHS.  That sort of works
better with the icons on the toolbar.  Still haven't looked at operations,
instantiations or deletions, though - operations should be easy, bit scared
about the other two.

On the UI front also, currently changing TableViewers in current transaction
view to TreeViewers, to support the composite pattern as used by the
ChangeSet.  Looks like the TransactionManager itself isn't aggregated
changes as I was expecting, so that needs looking at.

In a separate initiative, I've factored out advice from aspects: each
aspect's advice calls a corresponding method on a peer &quot;advice&quot; object.
This is primarily for easier refactoring in the future (unlike JDT, AJDT
doesn't really *do* refactoring); if I change any methods then the (regular
Java) advice object will be impacted.  The only thing one then needs to
worry about vis-a-vis aspects is the binding - something which is much more
stable.

Later.

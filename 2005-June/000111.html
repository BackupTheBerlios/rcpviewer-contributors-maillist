Sorry, I don't follow you here. I don't really understand why the 
metadata would have to change.
Can you elaborate?

---------------------

BTW, I have been thinking about domains, object stores, sessions, and 
associated UI since I have been working on my 2nd attempt to create a 
spike.
My goal is create a spike that does persistence.
Of course, that means that I have to use Dan's API. And that of course 
means that I have to create a Domain, and an ObjectStore, and a Session.
And that I have to get Mike's viewer to use a session, or sessions.

I can imagine an application that would allow the use to add new 
sessions (imagine an application like a newsreader, where you can add 
connections to new newsgroups at runtime).
Therefore, defining sessions declaratively is definitely not sufficient 
for all applications.
However, I can't (yet) imagine an application that allows the user to 
add new Domains to the application except by extending the application 
by adding plugins.
Therefore, defining domains declaratively seems sufficient.

----------------------------------
Back to my spike...

So far I have managed to segregate Mikes's viewer code into a plugin of 
it's own named de.berlios.rcpviewer.rcp.
I have create a plugin for my example name 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.easybean.  Mike's model classes are in this plugin.
I have imported all of Dan's plugins into my project 
(de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain, de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.runtime, etc).


So far, here is what I have done...
I added an extension point to the de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.runtime 
plugin named 'domains'.
The de.berlios.rcpviewer.easybean plugin declaritively exports a domain, 
like so...
   &lt;extension point=&quot;de.berlios.rcpviewer.runtime.domains&quot;&gt;
      &lt;domain id=&quot;domain&quot; class=&quot;mikespike3.model.EasyBeanDomain&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;
Notice that I am simply registering a class that implements the IDomain 
interface.
My mikespike3.model.EasyBeanDomain class subclasses the 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.Domain.
I added a 'DomainRegistry' class to the 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.runtime plugin.  The 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.rcp plugin uses this class to get a list of all 
available domains and thus to build the UI (initially, just create the 
'New' menu).
I added a getDomainRegistry() method to the 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.runtime.RuntimePlugin class.  I also added a 
method for getting the ISessionManager.

---------------------------
That's where I'm at right now.  My next step is to get the RCPViewer to 
create a new object and load it into the editor. 
Which brings up my next point...
...the de.berlios.rcpviewer.rcp plugin creates the UI for creating new 
objects.  When the user selects the File | New | EasyBean menu item to 
create a new EasyBean the associated action needs a Session to actually 
create the object.
How does the action get a Session to use?

For now what I have done is I have added addSession, getCurrentSession 
and setCurrentSession methods to the ISessionManager interface.
When the EasyBean application starts up it creates a session, adds it to 
the SessionManager and then makes the session the current session.
I imagine each RPCViewer application having it's own method of creating 
new sessions and switching between them.
------------------------

I think that b) will be problematic because the platform's design kinda 
assumes that there is one and only one, globally available, workbench.
I have run into problems trying to run more than one workbench within 
the same VM (part of some work I did for RSWT where I tried to run 
several RCP applications as server-side applications with thin-client 
front-ends;  never got it to work :-(,  but maybe some day.....

Anyway, in terms of a testing framework, maybe a good approach would be 
to create a 'test runner' that can run just a single test and then 
develop a test harness that can run many tests in separate VMs and 
aggregate the results.

-------------

Is there maybe anything in the Eclipse Testing Tools project that can 
help you here?  (I've looked at Haydes in the past but found the 
documentation not sufficient for my meager cognitive abilities ;-)).

</I>&gt;<i>I don't completely agree with you that annotations should be considered

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think I can summarise your concerns - which are legitimate - by saying

</I>&gt;<i>all the annotations etc.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>such there is nothing wrong with making these mandatory.  Trying to get by

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I agree that some annotations could be required.
Unfortunately, I'm not sure that I agree that @InDomain should be required.

However, forget about that for now, let me try to restate what I would 
really like from the Domain API...
What I really want is an interface-based Domain API that allows the 
&lt;implementation&gt; of the API to be plugable.
That way we really don't need to have debates about how the 
implementation should work.  If I need to be able to change the set of 
classes in a domain for different clients then I would be able to do 
that by swapping out the default Domain SPI with my own implementation. 

The default Domain implementation could be totally driven by 
annotations.  In fact, the default Domain implementation probably should 
totally annotation driven since such an implementation is probably the 
best solution for most projects. 
But do you want to create an RCPViewer built for a set of developers 
that want to develop an application in a specific fashion, or do you 
want an RCPViewer that can be adapted to a wide variety of situations?
Going back to Hibernate as an example... there is no reason to require 
anything to be specified as an annotations, the metadata layer should be 
totally implementation independent.




&gt;<i>Let me turn to the two examples you give.  First up, I agree that the use of
</I>&gt;<i>Hibernate annotations would be optional for all the reasons you give, and if
</I>&gt;<i>we were to implement a similar set of persistence annotations that could be
</I>&gt;<i>support Hibernate, JDO or EJB3 say then they too should be considered
</I>&gt;<i>optional.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Your &quot;client-ized&quot; labels are more subtle.  One of the features that needs
</I>&gt;<i>to be implement is to provide a way of identifying any feature - see
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/features/feature-ids.">http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/features/feature-ids.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>For example, consider:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>package com.mycompany.domain;
</I>&gt;<i>public class Customer {
</I>&gt;<i>  private String firstName;
</I>&gt;<i>  public String getFirstName() { ... }
</I>&gt;<i>}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The feature Id of firstName would be something like
</I>&gt;<i>com.mycompany.domain.Customer#firstName.  I then imagined that this could be
</I>&gt;<i>used as a key to i18n, or to help, or for security authorization, eg:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>in a ResourceBundle:
</I>&gt;<i>de.berlios.rcpviewer.i18n.com.mycompany.domain.Customer#firstName=Christian
</I>&gt;<i>Name
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>in some help file:
</I>&gt;<i>de.berlios.rcpviewer.help.com.mycompany.domain.Customer#firstName=The first
</I>&gt;<i>or given name of the customer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>part of a security service:
</I>&gt;<i>public void IAuthorizationService {
</I>&gt;<i>  public boolean isVisible(final String featureId);
</I>&gt;<i>  public boolean isUsable(final String featureId);
</I>&gt;<i>}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So, these feature Ids could be used for a clientization capability.  Or, to
</I>&gt;<i>be honest, one could think of your different clients as merely different
</I>&gt;<i>locales and just use the i18n feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I like this approach very much.
Why not extend the concept of feature ID to include domains and classes 
as well as attributes and methods, etc.
Then the Domain API could become a set of pluggable services that supply 
RCPViewer with information about all the features available in the system...

public interface IDomainService {
  public String[] getAllDomainFeatureIds();

  public String[] getAllChildFeatures(String featureId);
  public boolean contains(String parentFeatureId, String featureId);
  public FeatureType getFeatureType(featureId);

  public String getName(String featureId);
  public boolean isOrderable(String featureId);
  public boolean isReadOnly(String featureId);
  public int getLowerBound(String featureId);
 ...
}

public interface IObjectService {
  public Object createObject(String featureId);

  public void setValue(Object object, String featureId, Object value);
  public Object getValue(Object object, String featureId);
 ...
}



public interface IAuthorizationService {
  public boolean isVisible(String roleName, String featureId);
  public boolean isUsable(String roleName, String featureId);
 ...
}


public interface ILabelService {
  public String getLabel(String featureId);
 ...
}


public interface ISessionService {
 	public void peristObject(Object object);
 ...
}

...and so on.


Then, no more discussion about things work, only what needs to be done.



What do you guys think about such an API?

<PRE>Hi All,

I am interested in expanding the easybean example by adding security 
features.
This post is an overview of how I would like to implement security.

The goal of RCPViewer's security implementation seem pretty 
straighforward, that is...
...to be able to show/hide UI features based on the user's set of 'roles'
...be able to get the name of the current user (for display somewhere).
...not be tied to any particular authentication of authorization method.
...should not prevent code written to a particular A&amp;A API from being 
reused in an RCPViewer application.

----------------------------
Overview

RCPViewer does not need much in terms of authentication and 
authorization functionality. 
The only thing that I anticipate that RCPViewer will require is some API 
to determine who the current user is and to get that user's set of 
authorizations.
I don't anticipate that RPCViewer will be involved in actually 
performing authentication or actually securing calls to methods. 
The only thing that I anticipate that RCPViewer has to do is to 
customize the UI depending on who the user is and that user's set of 
authorizations.
I expect RCP applications to perform thier own authentication and that 
the user will have been authenicated BEFORE the RCP workbench is created 
(this is how the EasyBean eaxmple currently works).

There are two cataegories of information that RCPViewer will need...
...the user's name, and the set of Roles assigned to the user.
...the Roles assigned to domain features (domains, classes, attributes, 
methods, etc).

Seems like adding a couple of simple extensions to the Domain API would 
be sufficent.
I propose the following...

...add the following interface to the de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain plugin:
package de.berlios.rcpviewer.security;
public interface IUserAuthorizationService {
    String getName();
    Collection&lt;String&gt; getRoles();
}

...and add the following method to the IDomain interface...
    boolean isFeatureInRoles(Collection&lt;String&gt; roles, String featureId);

..and add the following interface to the de.berlios.domain.runtime plugin:
package de.berlios.rcpviewer.runtime.security;
public interface IDomainAuthorizationService {
    boolean isFeatureInRoles(Collection&lt;String&gt; roles, String featureId);
}

-----------------------------
Service Implementation

I expect that we will have more discussion about service implementation 
in the future.
However, for now I intend to implement services as OSGi services since 
Eclipse already contains infrastructure for discovering and managing 
such services.
I intend to implement these services in separate bundles so that they 
can be easily replaced with different implementations.

RCPViewer applications may integrate any security mechanism into 
RCPViewer by replacing the bundle that supplies the 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.security.user package. 
I intend to create two bundles with different implementions of the 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.security.domain package.
I will create one bundle named de.berlios.rcpviewer.security.user.acegi 
that wraps the Acegi toolkit and uses Acegi to implement the 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.security.user package.
I will create another bundle named 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.security.user.jaas that uses JAAS to implement the 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.security.user package.

RCPViewer applications may use any method for discovering domain 
authorization information by adding services that implement the 
IDomainAuthorizationService interface. 
I intend to create two bundles with different implementions of 
IDomainAuthorizationService .
I will create one bundle named 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.runtime.security.annotations and will use 
annotations to declare roles for classes, attributes, methods, etc.  
This plugin will inspect the annotations attached to POJO classes at 
runtime.  This plugin will expert a service with the name 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.runtime.security.annotations.AnnotationDomainAuthorizationService.
I will create another bundle named 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.runtime.security.xml that will use hierarchical xml 
configuration files to declare roles for classes, attributes, methods, 
etc.  This plugin will expert a service with the name 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.runtime.security.xml.XMLDomainAuthorizationService.

------------------------------
Supporting multiple domain authorization schemes within a single 
application.

It is assumed that there will never be a need to use multiple user 
authorization services within a single application.  If there is a need 
to integrate with multiple security domains then it is assumed that the 
user authorization service used in the application implements some kind 
of Single Sign On method that integrates the disparate domains.

However, it might be necessary to use bundles that export domains that 
use different domain authorization schemes.  For instance, suppose an 
application that uses the xml domain authorization scheme wants to reuse 
a bundle that exports a domain that uses the annotation authorization 
scheme.  This is why the isFeatureInRoles method has been added to the 
IDomain interface, because the implementation of the isFeatureInRoles is 
domain specific.
However, a domain implementation may simple delegate calls to its 
isFeatureInRoles method to one of the services named above.

------------------------------
Customizing the UI...

Given that we have an API for discovering the current user and the 
user's authorizations the next question is how to actually go about 
showing/hiding UI elements.

Eclipse Activities provides a mechanism by which UI features may be 
enabled and disabled based on categories of activities.
My first though was that we would be able to use the Eclipse Activities 
API for customizing the UI at runtime.  
However, there are a few the problems with using the Activities API...
...large RCP applications that actually want to use the Activities API 
to filter UI elements based  on task or context would interfer with our 
use of Activities.  That is, a UI element is shown if any of it's 
activites are enabled.
...activities can only be defined at design-time,
So, I have rejected the use of Activities.

Seems like each UI element created by RCPViewer will have to determine 
for itself whether it is visible or not by consulting the 
IUserDomainService and the IDomain for authorization info.



Clear as mud?
Comments and suggestions are welcome.

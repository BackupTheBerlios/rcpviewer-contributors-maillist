<PRE>Hi Ted,

I have just got stuck at the very stage you are asking me about - 
basically manipulating the domain model (as RcpViewer sees it) during tests.
Here's my logic:
* I do not see a runtime RcpViewer app having to deal with a changing 
domain (as I think, do you).  This simplifies things as we have no 
listening and GUI-regenerating mechanisms to deal with.
* However for test-driven development I need to test the various 
permutations on start-up.  This is particularly the case for a generic 
viewer such as RcpViewer that must be able to deal with any domain it is 
passed.
* Hence I want to programatically change the start-up conditions; i.e. 
change the domain, change the declared classes etc.
* Hence, between tests, I want to change whatever data RcpViewer uses to 
generate its GUI.  If this is based on our own extension points, I thus 
need to change Eclipse's extension registry.  This is what I meant by 
the 'metadata'.

Which is a bummer.

Actually I have a larger bummer at the moment.  I am trying to start the 
  main gui development with a basic window with a class bar (as per 
Dan's wiki) down the left-hand side. With an empty domain, everything is 
fine - I test for (and get) an error message as expected.  But the next 
step, i.e. the next test, requires the domain to be populated. I am 
struggling on how to do this when:
1) PDEUnit runs up a single instance for all tests
2) declarative stuff in extension points is handled on the plugin 
startup - well before PDEUnit calls setup() on any test.

Which is where I am at the moment.

I am very keen not to have to move to event listening on Dan's Domain 
object but currently other options I have explored (command line args, 
separate PDEUnit tests for each condition) are all worse ideas.

As to your issues.
Your extension point implementation for domains/classes seems fine 
(praise indeed eh?).
As for sessions I was thinking there would be one automatically started 
with the app (as you suggest) and some sort of mechanism for allowing 
the user to explicitly start others - and serviced with the types of 
API's you're developing,

As for representing multiple sessions visually my thoughts were along 
these lines:
* on the left-hand side of the screen is a session-independent 
'Outlook'-style class bas as Dan and yourself have suggested
* in the middle is the editor area
* on the right hand side are one or more of Dan's 'class explorer' 
views.  Each is a multi-root tree (one root per class) listing all 
instantiated instances within a session.  If there are multiple 
sessions, there are multiple views.
* the classbar and class explorer have similar context menus for 
new/find/list options only the classbar has to ask the user which 
session to use if more than one is available.  Ditto for File / New 
menus etc.
* this multi-session complexity would be hidden away unless unlocked via 
preferences.



Good luck with persistence - rather you than I!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I have been thinking about domains, object stores, sessions, and 
</I>&gt;<i> associated UI since I have been working on my 2nd attempt to create a 
</I>&gt;<i> spike.
</I>&gt;<i> My goal is create a spike that does persistence.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, that means that I have to use Dan's API. And that of course 
</I>&gt;<i> means that I have to create a Domain, and an ObjectStore, and a Session.
</I>&gt;<i> And that I have to get Mike's viewer to use a session, or sessions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can imagine an application that would allow the use to add new 
</I>&gt;<i> sessions (imagine an application like a newsreader, where you can add 
</I>&gt;<i> connections to new newsgroups at runtime).
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, defining sessions declaratively is definitely not sufficient 
</I>&gt;<i> for all applications.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I can't (yet) imagine an application that allows the user to 
</I>&gt;<i> add new Domains to the application except by extending the application 
</I>&gt;<i> by adding plugins.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, defining domains declaratively seems sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> Back to my spike...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far I have managed to segregate Mikes's viewer code into a plugin of 
</I>&gt;<i> it's own named de.berlios.rcpviewer.rcp.
</I>&gt;<i> I have create a plugin for my example name 
</I>&gt;<i> de.berlios.rcpviewer.easybean.  Mike's model classes are in this plugin.
</I>&gt;<i> I have imported all of Dan's plugins into my project 
</I>&gt;<i> (de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain, de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.runtime, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far, here is what I have done...
</I>&gt;<i> I added an extension point to the de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.runtime 
</I>&gt;<i> plugin named 'domains'.
</I>&gt;<i> The de.berlios.rcpviewer.easybean plugin declaritively exports a domain, 
</I>&gt;<i> like so...
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;extension point=&quot;de.berlios.rcpviewer.runtime.domains&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;domain id=&quot;domain&quot; class=&quot;mikespike3.model.EasyBeanDomain&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;/extension&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Notice that I am simply registering a class that implements the IDomain 
</I>&gt;<i> interface.
</I>&gt;<i> My mikespike3.model.EasyBeanDomain class subclasses the 
</I>&gt;<i> de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.Domain.
</I>&gt;<i> I added a 'DomainRegistry' class to the 
</I>&gt;<i> de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.runtime plugin.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> de.berlios.rcpviewer.rcp plugin uses this class to get a list of all 
</I>&gt;<i> available domains and thus to build the UI (initially, just create the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'New' menu).
</I>&gt;<i> I added a getDomainRegistry() method to the 
</I>&gt;<i> de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.runtime.RuntimePlugin class.  I also added a 
</I>&gt;<i> method for getting the ISessionManager.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> That's where I'm at right now.  My next step is to get the RCPViewer to 
</I>&gt;<i> create a new object and load it into the editor. Which brings up my next 
</I>&gt;<i> point...
</I>&gt;<i> ...the de.berlios.rcpviewer.rcp plugin creates the UI for creating new 
</I>&gt;<i> objects.  When the user selects the File | New | EasyBean menu item to 
</I>&gt;<i> create a new EasyBean the associated action needs a Session to actually 
</I>&gt;<i> create the object.
</I>&gt;<i> How does the action get a Session to use?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For now what I have done is I have added addSession, getCurrentSession 
</I>&gt;<i> and setCurrentSession methods to the ISessionManager interface.
</I>&gt;<i> When the EasyBean application starts up it creates a session, adds it to 
</I>&gt;<i> the SessionManager and then makes the session the current session.
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine each RPCViewer application having it's own method of creating 
</I>&gt;<i> new sessions and switching between them.
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------

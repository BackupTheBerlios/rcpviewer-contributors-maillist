<PRE>Hi All,

Incremental progress today : have taken the Gui as far as I ought to
without reference to Ted's stuff - which is not far at all. All that is
there is a basic classbar implementation with dummy actions.
Next steps:
1) I have (finally) got round to downloading Ted's stuff.  Currently 
have various funnies with it (non-existing plugins etc.) so will 
reference Dan's comments and get it working.
2) Then I can incorporate Ted's stuff which will probably be an 
overwrite-job on what I have got so far - though I'll try to strip out 
anything unnecessary (as per Ted's comments in his 're:PetStore' mail )
3) add a session view - this will be the tree of instances open in the
current session offering similar functionality to the classbar.
Then we have a basic app which can open editors, display the session etc
and I am off your individual critical paths.



Ted - with regards to the test framework - can we hold fire the above is
done - say until the end of this week?  The reason is that the only
architecturally-interesting part of the development so far is my use of
Jobs.  I am thinking that all UI actions will be scheduled Jobs.  Hence
we have an instant way into:
- undo / redo management
- Dan's aspirational scripting capability
- easier test harness control.
I was initially concerned that Jobs were perhaps a little heavyweight
for individual gui updates (especially those on key strokes) but once I
started poking around in the Tree and TableViewer implementations I
noted that Jobs are used for all updates and refreshes - hence I think
this might be a perfectly  reasonable proposal.

Mike E.

PS : other implementation notes within each plugin's wiki

PPS : do we use official Java programming standards?  I have
deliberately avoided the _ and __ prefixes though I like them.  Ted
clearly likes them.  Opinions?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other URLs cause Subclipse to barf when I try adding a new project.

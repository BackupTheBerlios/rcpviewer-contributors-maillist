<PRE>Okey-dokey.
Looks like my query regarding the DefautEditor's use of reflection to 
obtain getters and setters was apposite.
I gather you really expect it to use IDomainObject attributes and 
operations rather than do its own refelction.
This fits nicely with my Job model.
I want to make a generic:
DomainOperationJob( IDomainObject obj, Operation op ) {}...
which would be used for all setters as well as other ops.  Then tie the 
gui in as listeners upon this.
Which should also give the basis for the action-view.

</I>&gt;<i> You said next week you want to go back to the test harness, after consulting with Ted.  Since Ted is on vacation though, could you put that on hold and see if you could lash together a version of the action view (<A HREF="http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/features/action-view">http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/features/action-view</A>) or some other equivalent means of invoking actions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll then be able to do some meaningful work on a Petstore demo.  Also, there'll be something for me to &quot;work at&quot; in terms of enhancing the UI myself (in very small ways) to enforce some of the constraints and semantics of the metamodel.

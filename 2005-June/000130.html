<PRE>Hi All,

Projects
* de.berlios.rcpviewer.gui
* de.berlios.rcpviewer.gui.acme
committed.
They are essentially merge/rewrite of mikespike3 plus Ted's persistence 
stuff.  In fact de.berlios.rcpviewer.gui is a replacement for 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.rcp.  (Why I did not just update the latter I am 
not too sure).
Currently it does not include the Search capability as I will have to 
update the ...persistence.ui plugin - will do so tomorrow.

Attached after this note are the salient points from the wiki - please 
peruse and if anything interests you, then it might be worth taking a 
look at the source.

Next steps:
* add Ted's search stuff
* properly review Ted's persistence changes
* tidy everything ( consistent formatting etc, JAVADOC! )
* add session tree view
All intended for this week.

Next week I intend to get back to some TDD and have a chat with Ted 
regarding the test harness.

Mike E.




FROM WIKI:


'''Design Points'''
* A DomainBootstrapFactory used to allow options in the future.
* The returned IDomainBootstrap is wrapped in a  job.  This is strictly 
unecessary at the moment (indeed necesitates a join() call in plugin's 
startup()) but wrapping such long / heavy operations such as this in Job 
is one of my suggested standards.
* Similarly there is a session bootstrap job - this is in the plugin 
startup rather than the application initialisation so that, eventually, 
it can be configured via eclipse mechanisms.
* Ted's dummy authorisation wizard is left out for now.  Don't 
particularly like the wizard approach to login - I suggest a good ole' 
dialog.
* Currently no domains extesnion point - simply uses default - this is 
where the session bootstrap job could come in.

'''Current Errors'''
* second save() fails on editor - re: discussion between save() and 
persist() methods.

'''Suggested Standards'''
* wrap all log / complex operations in Job's
* 'eat your own dogfood' for all extension points  '''unless''' the 
fall-back default option; hecnce 'exts' sub-directories where extension 
points are implemented
* apart from explicit extension points, am '''not''' writing classes for 
extension, rather the opposite - trying to make as un-public as possible.
* use _ notation for fields (?)
* place constants on appropriate classes - not a global constant 
interface (an anti-pattern?)

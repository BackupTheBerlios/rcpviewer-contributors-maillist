</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Here's the problem I ran into... in the example app I chose File | New | 
EasyBean to create a new instance of na EasyBean.
Initally the EasyBean is not persisted, and it is marked as 'dirty', 
therefore the Save button is enabled on the toolbar.
I saved the EasyBean, and the editor calls domainObject.persist().

Then I make a change to the EasyBean and the state of the object once 
changes to 'dirty' and the Save button becomes enabled.
Hitting the Save button invokes domainObject.persist() a second time. 
PROBLEM: the domain object checked to see if it has already been 
persisted, which it was, and it threw up.

I could see having BOTH a persist method AND a save method on an 
IDomainObject but I was not sure what you meant to do.
In a way similar to Hibernate, the  persist method would make an object 
persistent while the save method would cause changes to the object to be 
flushed to the store when the associated transaction is committed.

OR, what I did, the persist method makes the object peristent on the 
first call AND saves the object, and just saves the object on all 
subsequent calls.



-------------------------------------------

Oops, sorry, will do.  I was not aware that there were tests available.

&gt;<i>2. DomainRegistry &amp; Domain subclasses vs a final Domain
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ok, I understand what you've done, it is different from what I had in mind,
</I>&gt;<i>but I *think* I prefer your approach.  Let me go through the alternatives
</I>&gt;<i>and tell me if you wildly disagree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My original idea was that Domain was final and acted as its own static hash
</I>&gt;<i>(see Domain#instance(String)).  When (somehow) a domain class is looked up
</I>&gt;<i>(= registered), then an owning Domain would be lazily instantiated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Your design inverts this - you make the Domain itself (or rather a subclass)
</I>&gt;<i>responsible for registering the domain classes that it owns.  Since the
</I>&gt;<i>Domain already exists, it makes sense that it is given to a hash; rather
</I>&gt;<i>than having a static hash within Domain, you instead have DomainRegistry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The question to me is: where does the responsibility for knowing which
</I>&gt;<i>classes make up a domain reside?  I have remained mute on the answer, while
</I>&gt;<i>you've decided that the domain itself should know this.  I can't see an
</I>&gt;<i>argument against that position to be honest, so what I think I'll do is to
</I>&gt;<i>go with your design: I'll remove the static hash from Domain and refactor my
</I>&gt;<i>tests to use the DomainRegistry that you introduced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
One other issue here is how the Domain should register classes.  The  
EasyBeanDomain class  is forced to  'trick'  the Domain  class into  
registering  classes by calling the lookup method....

public class EasyBeanDomain
extends Domain
{

    public EasyBeanDomain()
    throws CoreException
    {
        super(EasyBeanExample.PLUGIN_ID);

        // register classes
        if (lookup(EasyBean.class) == null) {
            String msg= &quot;Failed to register class in 
domain:&quot;+EasyBean.class.getName();
            Status status= new Status(Status.ERROR, 
EasyBeanExample.PLUGIN_ID, 0, msg, null);
            throw new CoreException(status);
        }
    }

}

...the intent would be clearer if there was a 'registerClass' method.


-------------------------------------------



&gt;<i>By the way, I noticed you using the old double check idiom in one of the
</I>&gt;<i>methods:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>//	REVIEW_CHANGE Added this method.  ted
</I>&gt;<i>	public IDomainRegistry getDomainRegistry() {
</I>&gt;<i>		try {
</I>&gt;<i>			if (_domainRegistry == null) {
</I>&gt;<i>				synchronized (this) {
</I>&gt;<i>					if (_domainRegistry == null)
</I>&gt;<i>						_domainRegistry= new DomainRegistry();
</I>&gt;<i>				}
</I>&gt;<i>			}
</I>&gt;<i>			return _domainRegistry;
</I>&gt;<i>		}
</I>&gt;<i>		catch (CoreException x) {
</I>&gt;<i>			getLog().log(x.getStatus());
</I>&gt;<i>			throw new RuntimeException(x);
</I>&gt;<i>		}
</I>&gt;<i>	}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But this is broken, isn't it
</I>&gt;<i>(<A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html">http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html</A>)?
</I>&gt;<i>Or did JDK 5.0 fix it?  At any rate, I've just made these methods
</I>&gt;<i>synchronized.  If you know better, we can reinstate your version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Are you calling me old!?  Just kidding.

According to the link we should also change the _domainRegistry 
reference to static.
Doing that will ensure that the _domainRegistry reference is intialized 
once and only once before any caller can reference it.

&gt;<i>3 Sessions
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You added some methods to SessionManager, and asked &quot;How does the action get
</I>&gt;<i>a Session to use?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The design I had was that there is also a SessionFactory in addition to
</I>&gt;<i>Session and SessionManager, see AbstractRuntimeTestCase.  The job of the
</I>&gt;<i>SessionFactory is to hold together a Domain (or rather, the name of a
</I>&gt;<i>Domain) along with an ObjectStore.  The SessionFactory can then create a
</I>&gt;<i>Session for the Domain and using the ObjectStore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Actually, I called it SessionFactory, but it's more of a binding:
</I>&gt;<i>(Marketing, London)
</I>&gt;<i>(Marketing, NY)
</I>&gt;<i>(Order Mgmt, London)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>or
</I>&gt;<i>(Cust Services, Development)
</I>&gt;<i>(Cust Services, Production)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The question I guess I should pose myself though is would one ever have:
</I>&gt;<i>(Cust Services, Development)
</I>&gt;<i>(Cust Services, Development)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>and I suppose the answer actually is &quot;no&quot;.  So then, why do I have a
</I>&gt;<i>factory, why not just instantiate Sessions directly rather than
</I>&gt;<i>SessionFactorys? Good question, don't know.  Huh, I think I need to refactor
</I>&gt;<i>again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think what I'll do is keep your SessionManager#addSession, but make it
</I>&gt;<i>responsible for creating the session at the same time.  And then get rid of
</I>&gt;<i>the SessionFactory completely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In that case I think that you should also change the name from 
SessionManager#addSession to SessionManager#createSession.


&gt;<i>I also haven't solved the question about how does the user indicate which
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;session&quot; to use, so I think that getCurrentSession/setCurrentSession are
</I>&gt;<i>still needed.  Regarding the longer term question of switching sessions,
</I>&gt;<i>I'll add a feature request onto the wiki.  Perhaps have some sort of
</I>&gt;<i>dedicated view that just lists the sessions currently instantiated, a bit
</I>&gt;<i>like how one selects a database when using MS SQL Server (or a schema when
</I>&gt;<i>using Oracle if you like that sort of thing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not so sure about the getCurrentSession/setCurrentSession methods 
myself.
Adding those methods was really just a convenience until maybe we came 
up with something better.

My thinking was that the UI would somehow indicate the current session.
And maybe different applications might prefer different methods for 
choosing/indicating the session.
For instance, in Thunderbird (the e-mail client that I use) the current 
'session' would be associated with the currently selected folder in the 
'Folders' view.
Or, an application might choose to have separate perspectives for each 
session.
Or, maybe the session might be settable in Preferences.

The way a UI could manage the 'current' session would be to switch the 
current session everytime a session-switching UI event occurs.
For instance, when the perspective is changed to a perspective 
associated with a different session then the UI would call 
SessionManager#setCurrentSession.

Alternatively, we could maybe have a way to provide the SessionManager 
with an application-specific Strategy object that would be able to 
provide the SessionManager with the current session.

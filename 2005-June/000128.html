<PRE>Finally found a little time &amp; spent most of of it getting back into things.

There is a mike spike4 that works etc. but I do not really think its 
worth any one's time to review.  Its the working part of my test harness 
explorations and involves such concepts as TestSessions and scheduled 
StartUpJobs.  If I get that to a point where I think it might be worth 
bringing into main development I'll let you know and seek feedback. 
Until then its stored away in mikespike4.

Have also started the 'gui' projects in the main workspace.  They work 
but are not even as functional as mikespike3 yet.  Next steps are to 
look at Ted's persistence stuff and build that in.  Not a test in sight 
but I am rushing now to make good the last few lost weeks.

There is the 'gui' project with core code and the 'gui acme' project 
which is (will be) an example domain on top of it.

I suggest not much looking at them until my next alert as there is 
nothing really new as yet, and as stated, I have not built-in Ted's 
stuff yet.

Mike E.

<PRE>Ted:
thanks for your response, I've replied to contributors mailing list so that
this thread is archived (for those joining the conversation, background to
this thread is at the end):

I don't completely agree with you that annotations should be considered
optional but your remarks have helped me clarify in my mind where
annotations can be used and where we should use some other form of metadata
(eg XML).

I think I can summarise your concerns - which are legitimate - by saying
that annotations should be optional to capture metadata that may vary on a
deployment-by-deployment basis.  The two examples you gave, of mapping to a
perhaps legacy database, or for labels of fields in the UI, are both
examples of this.  And the reason is clear: if deploying an application at a
new site one wouldn't want to have to go through the source code and change
all the annotations etc.

However, I think it is valid to use annotations for metadata that is
intrinsic to the domain itself (rather than merely the deployment of the
domain in some context).  Most of the annotations to date fall into this
category (eg @Associates,  @LowerBoundOf, @UpperBoundOf and @Unique).  As
such there is nothing wrong with making these mandatory.  Trying to get by
without @Associates is all but impossible.  And I include @InDomain as one
of these.

Let me turn to the two examples you give.  First up, I agree that the use of
Hibernate annotations would be optional for all the reasons you give, and if
we were to implement a similar set of persistence annotations that could be
support Hibernate, JDO or EJB3 say then they too should be considered
optional.

Your &quot;client-ized&quot; labels are more subtle.  One of the features that needs
to be implement is to provide a way of identifying any feature - see
<A HREF="http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/features/feature-ids.">http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/features/feature-ids.</A>
For example, consider:

package com.mycompany.domain;
public class Customer {
  private String firstName;
  public String getFirstName() { ... }
}

The feature Id of firstName would be something like
com.mycompany.domain.Customer#firstName.  I then imagined that this could be
used as a key to i18n, or to help, or for security authorization, eg:

in a ResourceBundle:
de.berlios.rcpviewer.i18n.com.mycompany.domain.Customer#firstName=Christian
Name

in some help file:
de.berlios.rcpviewer.help.com.mycompany.domain.Customer#firstName=The first
or given name of the customer

part of a security service:
public void IAuthorizationService {
  public boolean isVisible(final String featureId);
  public boolean isUsable(final String featureId);
}

So, these feature Ids could be used for a clientization capability.  Or, to
be honest, one could think of your different clients as merely different
locales and just use the i18n feature.

Finally, when I was thinking about this response, I was going to quote
&quot;@MaxLength&quot; (of an attribute, eg email address) as an annotation that might
be intrinsic to the domain.  However, it occurred to me that maybe your
different clients (ie different deployments) might specify different
lengths.  Perhaps for the majority a default of 50 characters might be
enough, but you have one client who insists that it should be 100
characters.  So this made me think that maybe annotations should be
overridable: the information absolutely is needed, but will be looked up
from a properties file and only if not present will the annotation be used.
Hence:

package com.mycompany.domain;
public class Customer {
  private String emailAddress;
  @MaxLengthOf(50)
  public String getEmailAddress() { ... }
}

would be enough for most, but at your client who insists on 100 character
email addresses you would also deploy:

de.berlios.rcpviewer.progmodel.standard.MaxLengthOf.com.mycompany.domain.Cus
tomer#emailAddress=100

Your thoughts?

</I>&gt;<i> I hadn't imagined annotation-processing as a REQUIREMENT for using the

</I>&gt;<i> As a general solution for specifying metadata I know that annotations
</I>&gt;<i> will work for a lot of projects but I am not crazy in love with the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of using them.
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, suppose I need to map the same domain to several different

</I>&gt;<i> for instance, if we need to integrate our General Ledger with a thirdy
</I>&gt;<i> party General Ledger).
</I>&gt;<i> I would NOT want to use annotations because annotations limit me to only
</I>&gt;<i> one mapping, I would rather put the mapping in an XML file and use a
</I>&gt;<i> different XML file at runtime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as RCPViewer annotations go, I could only be comfortable with
</I>&gt;<i> using annotations if I can be sure that I can replace ALL labels defined
</I>&gt;<i> in annotations at runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> The labels in our product not only need to be internationalized but they
</I>&gt;<i> need to be 'client-ized&quot;.  That is, different clients use different
</I>&gt;<i> terms for the same thing and we change the labels in our application to
</I>&gt;<i> suit them.  For instance, some clients use the term &quot;Sales Agreement&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> while other clients use the term &quot;Customer Acknowledgement&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I imagined eventually having the RCPViewer metadata in an XML file that
</I>&gt;<i> I could process at runtime and replace tokens with the approriate labels.
</I>&gt;<i> This would be a mechanism that I would build specifically for our
</I>&gt;<i> application, but that could be hooked into the framework in some fashion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So... I think there should be a way to discover or register domains at
</I>&gt;<i> runtime and it should be a generic mechanism that does NOT depend on the
</I>&gt;<i> use of annotations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The annotation tooling should be built on top of the RCP Viewer
</I>&gt;<i> framework, however, I think that the framework should remain
</I>&gt;<i> independent of
</I>&gt;<i> annotations and other tooling.
</I>&gt;<i> Developers that want to use annotations can use the OPTIONAL annotation
</I>&gt;<i> support to annotate thier classes and have the domain and whatever
</I>&gt;<i> automagically generated for them.
</I>&gt;<i> Hibernate annotations, <A HREF="http://www.hibernate.org/247.html,">http://www.hibernate.org/247.html,</A> is an
</I>&gt;<i> example of how I imagined annotations would be used along with
</I>&gt;<i> the RCP Viewer.

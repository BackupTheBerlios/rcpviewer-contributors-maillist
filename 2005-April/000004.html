<PRE>RPC Software sells an ERP system for small &amp; medium sized businesses.  
Our customers absolutely need to track the changes made to certain 
documents, like customer orders.  Our product currently only implements 
a rudimentary audit trail facility for only a couple of documents types, 
customer orders and comission plans, and the implementation for both are 
ad hoc methods that were added to the system later in it's development.

I imagine that most systems for which the NO framework would be useful 
would also benefit from pervasive and consistent support for object 
'versioning'.
 From the user perspective I imagine a separate view for every object 
that can list, in order from most recent to least recent,  the changes 
to the object and who made those changes.
Of course, the NO peristence layer would have to be extended to include 
this facility.

Since we are developing an NO implementation based on the Eclipse 
framework perhaps it would be possible to have a 'basic' NO 
implementation, and then have Eclipse extension points that would make 
it possible to *contribute* additional views to the standard object viewer.
I imagine the standard NO object viewer as a multi-tabbed editor.  We 
could have an NO extension point that would allow a third-party plugin 
to add an additional tab to the standard NO object viewer.  This the NO 
'versioning' support could then be developed as a separate plugin and 
then included only when a system requires versioning.

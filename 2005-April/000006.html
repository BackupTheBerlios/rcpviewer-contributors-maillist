<PRE>(First, Ted ... I'll copy over your most recent postings to this list when
the wiki is back online.  I've had some of the some thoughts - all good
stuff).


I share Ted's concerns about NO being licensed under GPL - it doesn't make
sense for a commercial company such as Ted's or Mike's to contribute their
expertise to a project ultimately is bound by GPL.

Having worked with Richard and Rob intensively over the last year, there is
every chance that they will move back to LGPL.  The history is that they
started as GPL, went over to LGPL, and then, when NO Group Ltd. was formed
to act as the NO framework's custodian, moved to the dual GPL/commercial
license.

Once the Irish DSFA project is out of the door, their intent is do
&quot;relaunch&quot; the NO framework: it will, after all, have a substantial
reference site at that time.  I think they'll then take the opportunity to
move back to LGPL.  My estimate is this will be Q3 (perhaps v. early Q4).

If we get RCPViewer in a usable state before that time, then I'll push hard
for a change in license.  Because having other viewing mechanisms endorses
the NO concept, and because it is *me* acting as project lead, then I am
pretty sure they'll change the license earlier.

Dan

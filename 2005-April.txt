Hi all,

The ability to bookmark objects would be cool.
Fortunately the RCP already provides us with a general facility for 
creating such bookmarks and a standard view for viewing and opening 
bookmarks.

'Resource markers' are the standard facility for creating 'bookmarks', 
http://help.eclipse.org/help30/index.jsp?topic=workingSet=developers%20guide&searchWord=bookmark

The standard 'Bookmarks' view in the RCP will display all markers of 
type IMarker.BOOKMARK, 
http://help.eclipse.org/help30/index.jsp?topic=workingSet=developers%20guide&searchWord=bookmark

--------

A standard action available on every object 'editor' should be "Add 
Bookmark..."

RPC Software sells an ERP system for small & medium sized businesses.  
Our customers absolutely need to track the changes made to certain 
documents, like customer orders.  Our product currently only implements 
a rudimentary audit trail facility for only a couple of documents types, 
customer orders and comission plans, and the implementation for both are 
ad hoc methods that were added to the system later in it's development.

I imagine that most systems for which the NO framework would be useful 
would also benefit from pervasive and consistent support for object 
'versioning'.
 From the user perspective I imagine a separate view for every object 
that can list, in order from most recent to least recent,  the changes 
to the object and who made those changes.
Of course, the NO peristence layer would have to be extended to include 
this facility.

Since we are developing an NO implementation based on the Eclipse 
framework perhaps it would be possible to have a 'basic' NO 
implementation, and then have Eclipse extension points that would make 
it possible to *contribute* additional views to the standard object viewer.
I imagine the standard NO object viewer as a multi-tabbed editor.  We 
could have an NO extension point that would allow a third-party plugin 
to add an additional tab to the standard NO object viewer.  This the NO 
'versioning' support could then be developed as a separate plugin and 
then included only when a system requires versioning.

Hi all,

I should have looked at the NO license before now, however I just 
checked and NO is licensed under the GPL.
Ouch.  I don't want to create a GPL-licensed product.  That would 
prevent the company that I work for from building a product based on the 
NO framework and the RCPViewer without licensing our product under the 
GPL (which isn't going to happen) or without licensing the framework 
under commercial terms (which isn't going to happen either).
Granted, if I build the RCPViewer then the NO Foundation (or whoever 
would control the copyright) might see fit to grant my company a free 
license.
Even so, I am a dedicated evangelist of the Eclipse platform.  I see my 
professional future, and my company's future as being tightly bound to 
the success of the Eclipse platform in general.  I truly believe that a 
less restrictive license like the Eclipse Public License is the Eclipse 
community's best interest and therefore in my best interest.

Any thought about changing the NO framework license to something less 
restrictive?  LGPL maybe?

-------------

P.S.  My apologies for not checking earlier.

(First, Ted ... I'll copy over your most recent postings to this list when
the wiki is back online.  I've had some of the some thoughts - all good
stuff).


I share Ted's concerns about NO being licensed under GPL - it doesn't make
sense for a commercial company such as Ted's or Mike's to contribute their
expertise to a project ultimately is bound by GPL.

Having worked with Richard and Rob intensively over the last year, there is
every chance that they will move back to LGPL.  The history is that they
started as GPL, went over to LGPL, and then, when NO Group Ltd. was formed
to act as the NO framework's custodian, moved to the dual GPL/commercial
license.

Once the Irish DSFA project is out of the door, their intent is do
"relaunch" the NO framework: it will, after all, have a substantial
reference site at that time.  I think they'll then take the opportunity to
move back to LGPL.  My estimate is this will be Q3 (perhaps v. early Q4).

If we get RCPViewer in a usable state before that time, then I'll push hard
for a change in license.  Because having other viewing mechanisms endorses
the NO concept, and because it is *me* acting as project lead, then I am
pretty sure they'll change the license earlier.

Dan

Now supports mutators as well as accessors; the IDomainClass provides
convenience methods to query various flags of its attributes (since some of
our semantics are held in annotations rather than intrinsic to EMF, using
IDomainClass hides this detail).

Message-ID: <LGEELLOAEBMLCOGIKLMKCEFMDCAA.dan@haywood-associates.co.uk>

Have done some more work on the metamodel ("workspace/emf-builder" in SVN).

Additionally, have started to put a bit of scaffolding so that the UI can
instantiate, persist and retrieve domain objects. The "persistence" is just
into in-memory hashes, but that's good enough for testing against.

In particular, I've described the use of a Eclipse-plugin which provides a

for documentation relating to the emf-builder project.

I while back I posted a long (of course!) description of my typlical

Then Dan's web site had some problems and that description got lost from 
the wiki.

Well, I'm not gonna repost the description because I've learned better.  
After playing with Mike's original project post I took the time to learn 
more about the PDE and have come to the conclusion that I've been doing 
things the hard way!

Hi All,

I've been looking at Dan's code in the emf-builder project.
The only comment I have so far is about the 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.session.ISession interface and the 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.session.local.Session class.  I don't think that 
they are necessary.

I've been working on my own spike, a rewrite of the "Purchase Order" 
example application from the "Eclipse Modeling Framework" book.
In the book a small application is generated by creating the domain 
model (A 'PurchaseOrder' with some 'LineItems' and 'Locations') and then 
the application is generated (which includes XML persistence and a GUI).
 From my perspective generating an application is a non-starter - I need 
a framework that can be extended at runtime.  That is, I need to be able 
to add a third-party plugin to a running system that can add an 
attribute to an existing class - and then have a field for that new 
attribute show up in the GUI.
My idea is to rewrite the application so that no generating is involved, 
the developer creates the domain model and then deploys the application 
with the RCPViewer.  I am gonna use Hibernate for persistence (hopefully 
I can create the Hibernate mapping at runtime).
The application is very small and simple...  my idea is that we can all 
rewrite our spikes until we gel on a common code base and then expand 
the spikes with 'features'.

Anyway, back to the reason for this post... the Session interface 
appears to be responsible for providing the IDomainObject adapters for a 
POJO.
In Eclipse-land there is already a very good way to manage the creation 
of such adapters - the org.eclipse.core.runtime.IAdapterManager interface.
In Eclipse I would plan on getting the IDomainObject for a POJO in this 
way...

IAdapterManager adapterManager= Platform.getAdapterManager();
IDomainObject domainObject= adapterManager.getAdapter(pojo, 
IDomainObject.class);

Can now:
- instantiate domain object
- set values of attribute
- get values of attribute
- persist
- detach from session
- attach to session
- get session's footprint of attached objects of given type
- retrieve from storage (initially unattached to session)

Haven't yet done operations or relationships.

I shan't have the opportunity to do much for a few days, but hopefully
there's enough for Mike to get his teeth into.

Hi,

Done no coding yet.
Down on client side all week trying, amongst other things, to get 
Windows 98 clients to talk Java 5 over RMI (sigh...)

Anyway next week I'll get going.  As I am in the mood for using the

Using Java 5 is fine with me as part of my motivation for getting involved
is to be able to use the new shiny things too.

Hopefully Java 5 will be available on the Mac in the next month or so.

Would using this version lock out any significant number of potential users?
(I'd say probably not as major products, like WebLogic, are now requiring
it)

Subject: Re: [Rcpviewer-contributors] Persistence

I see the GUI simply as a client of the model.  Extending IDomainObject
from any UI type is inappropriate.  I read a great paper off the
alphaworks website years ago (alas can remeber no title nor author)
explaining how type families should define one's intentions.  And I
would argue that a generic business object type should not be part of
any type family defining orthogonal functionalities such as persistence.

... What does us our resident consultant think, Dan?

&gt;&gt;<i> I replied to Ted's posting on this yesterday saying I didn't have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem with IDomainObject extended ISaveablePart.  But actually, on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reflection I think I do.  Although I don't see IDomainObject itself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as ever being reused outside of Eclipse, I would like to see IDomainClass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being used outside (eg in Chris Nelson's Trails project).  Since an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IDomainClass has a method createTransient which returns an IDomainObject,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this says that IDomainObject should not extend from the Eclipse API.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> Ted also responded earlier today, saying he was gonna put save logic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> onto IObjectStore.  Sounds like a good plan to me - I think we're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all on the same page.  I suspect that if Hibernate or EJB3 were being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used as the persistence mechanism, there wouldn't actually be much for
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> IObjectStore to do, but it would still take responsibility for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mapping the &quot;save&quot; lifecycle event of an IDomainObject over to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corresponding state change for the underlying persistence mechanism.
</I>

PS : What about transactional control?  Are we going down the NO route
of having objects representing transactions - a bit of a leap for most
object modellers?

&gt;&gt;<i> I think the NO route to transactions works well, though I'm not sure I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite understand your remark because there are two different idioms to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delimit a transaction within NO.  The first and simplest is to write
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a simple action method, as displayed on the object's menu.  All
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modifications to objects that result from that action invokation are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> performed in a single transaction.  This is good enough for most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> circumstances.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> The other approach (and the one I think you were referring to) is to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encapsulate the transaction as an object which, when persisted,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> represents the change.  The classic example is a bank transfer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rather than have an action called &quot;transferTo&quot; on a BankAccount which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> takes as a parameter another BankAccount objects and an amount, we
</I>instead
&gt;&gt;<i> would have an action called &quot;makeTransfer&quot; that would take two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BankAccount objects, an amount, and would return a TransferTransaction.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It all comes down to whether the action itself is a domain object.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sometimes it is, sometimes not.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> By the way, at the DSFA there is a requirement to audit certain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transactions.  The way we implemented this was to write a generic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capability (in the NO framework) for any object (or a bounded graph of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objects) into XML, along with corresponding XSD schema.  This is then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recorded.  Because it is XML, it can then be rendered into other formats,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eg for reviewing by auditors, or for reporting upon (how many actions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type X did we do in July, etc?)
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> In fact, we used this XML capability as part of the implementation of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Communication object representing pro-forma communications.  The user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has to specify the bits of the form that vary, within the business
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> object itself (and therefore typesafe).   The communication object is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> converted into XML, and then we used Altova's Stylevision to build an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> XSL-FO XSLT to convert this XML into a PDF.  It'd be very nice to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something similar for RcpViewer.  I would see this PDF view/preview as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being an additional tab on the object's editor.
</I>

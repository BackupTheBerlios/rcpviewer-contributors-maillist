<PRE>Opinions, please on the following:

At the moment I've been presuming that a metamodel will be instantiated just
once within a client-side JVM.  Its contents are IDomainClasses: the
relationship between MetaModel and IDomainClass is 1:m bidirectional.

Similarly, there is an ISession that contains the IDomainObjects that have
been resolved and are known about for this client.  Again 1:m bidirectional.
Every IDomainObject knows its IDomainClass (m:1 unidirectional).  I've also
just realized that really an ISession is an instantiation of a MetaModel, so
probably should reference it (1:1 unidirectional).

The following summarizes this (use a fixed size font!):

Session       (1) -&gt; (1) MetaModel
  ^ (1)                      ^ (1)
  |                          |
  V (m)                      V (m)
IDomainObject (m) -&gt; (1) IDomainClass


Now, I've been considering allowing multiple metamodels, and thus multiple
sessions, to be instantiated client side.  As an example, consider an RCP
app for bug tracking.  I can think of perhaps 3 domains (= metamodels):
- one representing the bug reports, priorities, issues, problems,
developers, releases and so forth.  This is the &quot;core&quot; domain would probably
be persisted using an RDBMS or EJB3.
- one representing say a chat room app, with chat room, message,
subscription etc.  When a priority #1 bug report comes in then a message can
be sent to a corresponding chat room.  This domain might not have any
persistence other than an in-memory representation held server-side.
- one representing the code base, with files, branches, tags and so forth.
This could be implemented using a persistent object store that delegates to
Subversion

Another example:
- Customer domain, eg for orders
- Filesystem domain, for maintaining any correspondence received from them
(a bit like I see in Mike's EPIC application)

As another final (hackneyed) example, consider a library.  A couple of
domains might be:
- the loan management domain (books, titles, loans, reservations)
- the stock management domain (stock items)

My simplifying assumption is that a single IDomainObject appears only in a
single domain.  So a Book in the loan domain is not the same object as a
Stock in the stock management domain.  However, a Book would know that it is
Stock, and so would have a reference to an IDomainObject whose IDomainClass
belonged to a different meta-model.

This then starts to firm up (in my mind) what an ISession is: it's a
collection of objects where the application can transparently traverse from
one object to another (&quot;walk the object graph&quot;).  If one has a reference to
an object in another domain, then the responsibility for traversing the
graph moves to the domain object itself:  typically it would use a lookup
method (eg Book would use its stock_item_ref to look up its corresponding
Stock object).

What then are the implications for the GUI?  My thinking is perhaps to use a
label or icon to represent the domain.  And probably also that the &quot;objects&quot;
view (the LHS of Mike's spike, more-or-less) probably would have multiple
tabs, one for each domain.

And what are the implications for the programming model?  I'm thinking
perhaps of introducing an optional @MetaModel annotation on classes.  If
missing, then the class is presumed to live in the &quot;default&quot; metamodel -
most RCP apps will only need to support a single domain.  But if present, it
would indicate the name of the metamodel.

@MetaModel(&quot;Filesystem&quot;)
public class WordDoc { ... }

@MetaModel(&quot;InstantMessaging&quot;)
public class Message { ... }

There would then be a hash of metamodels, held as a singleton, eg:
MetaModel.instanceNamed(&quot;Filesystem&quot;)

Does any of the above make sense?  I do think it's worth supporting, else
there is a potential scalability issue.    And it probably is worth
considering as part of the design of the GUI.

But let me know your thoughts...

Dan

Yes I was. 
It occurred to me that it wasn't a good idea to do all this coding 
before we had any discussion about where things were going.
I also posted a message in the EMF newsgroup asking for comments about 
the usability of the EMF UI but got no responses.
I get the definite impression that nobody is using EMF for end-user apps 
or has even thought about it.  In this regard NO seems at the very 
leading edge of UI development. 

&gt;<i>I think the Navigator view looks very nice.  Nice and clean.  Perhaps &quot;List&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>should be &quot;Search&quot; - in practical terms one wouldn't want to have a list of
</I>&gt;<i>every Customer.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>FYI - the contents of the Navigator and Actions views were cut and 
pasted from QuickBooks Simple Start Edition.
There are several UI ideas in this application that I like a lot.

I agree with you about the 'List' vs 'Search' thing.  Although with 
SWT's 'Virtual' table and a peristence layer that can do lazy loading 
it's practical to display a list of all customers.


&gt;<i>Not nearly so sure about the main view.  While I think that it would be fine
</I>&gt;<i>to have individual views that hold either then left hand side tree or the
</I>&gt;<i>right-hand side properties, it doesn't (I'm afraid) cut it to me as having
</I>&gt;<i>anywhere near the level of sophistication for typical end-users.  I did some
</I>&gt;<i>street testing on the wife and in-laws - they agree I'm afraid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What I am aiming for is something with the sophistication of Mike's RCP app
</I>&gt;<i>(eg <A HREF="http://www.incremental.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/screenshots/marketing.png">http://www.incremental.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/screenshots/marketing.png</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>or Schoolclipse
</I>&gt;<i>(<A HREF="https://schoolclipse.dev.java.net/files/documents/2161/10318/Clip2.gif">https://schoolclipse.dev.java.net/files/documents/2161/10318/Clip2.gif</A>) or
</I>&gt;<i>Xinity (<A HREF="http://www.xinity.org/?About/Xinity%20BASE">http://www.xinity.org/?About/Xinity%20BASE</A>).  Ultimately I'd like
</I>&gt;<i>UIs with the sophistication of MS Outlook or equivalent.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I like Mike's screenshot of the Customer view a lot.
Ultimately I would like the Properties pane in my application to look 
like that.

However, a single view like Mike's customer view would not work for many 
of the objects our application displays (my guess is that the Customer 
view doesn't work well for all of the objects that Epic displays either).
Here's why...consider an order that has hundred's or thousands of line 
items on it.  In terms of Mike's Customer view, consider how that view 
would work if the Customer has a thousand Contacts. 
When first displayed you could either...

 a) have the contacts list expanded, in which case the uses won't be see 
the below the contacts list.  Not good, because users are like newborn 
babies, if they can't see then it doesn't exist!, or

b) have the contacts list collapsed, in which case the properties below 
the list disappear.  Again not good, because of my rule that users are 
like newborn babies, if they can't see then it doesn't exist. 
In any case, a really long list of items will make it hard to navigate 
through the view.

So, to solve these problems I think an outline pane is neccessary.  The 
outline  view affords  the user with 'context' about their current 
location within a large object tree and it also provides for easier 
navigation within the object.
The outline pane could be optional.

-----------------

Also, the Eclipse IDE put the outline in a view that is separate from 
the editors.  I chose to put the outline inside the editor in a separate 
pane inside the editor.  I did this because I figure that not all 
editors that would be displayed in an RCPViewer application would be 
instances of an RCPViewer.  A typical application will have other 
editors that display HTML pages,  or screenshot of incoming Faxs, etc, 
that is, objects that do not have an outline or for which for an outline 
view cannot be constructed.
I didn't want to waste the screen real estate an an outline view that 
wouldn't be used all the time.

Also, I thought it might make it clearer to the user that the outline 
pane is displaying an outlien of the object that they're looking at if 
the outline was contained within the same editor as the properties view.


&gt;<i>So I'm sorry that the above sounds a little negative.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not a problem.  I've been a developer since 1988.  I have developed an 
incredibly thick skin.
I'm sure we've all had to sit in meeting's where someone spends a hour 
questioning the usability of your application because the color scheme 
is all wrong ;-).

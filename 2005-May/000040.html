Let's crawl before we can walk, let alone run.
Ted's screenshot is a very desirable interim target.

In fact my thoughts were that such a GUI would be the default based on
annotations without any decorations added.  Methinks Dan is after much
richer base GUI semantics than either Ted or I had in mind.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm very happy to start off with Ted's screenshot, and I'm not setting
</I>any dates for when we might get to my vision :-)  But it's as well that you
guys know what I'm aspiring to.


---
To be a little more concrete let's take for a simple example, ordering
String fields in an editor ... the options that occur to me are:
a) the sort order is built into the metamodel which sort the array from
annotation values on the domain POJO's.
b) GUI checks for an ISortAdapter which if found first re-sorts the
array as per its ( xml-based..?) configuration
c) the GUI is user-configurable presenting the user with a default list
and then allowing items to be moved up and down - it then remembers this
order for all future instances (this is sort of like the old Lotus Notes
interface)
d) the GUI applies it own hard-coded rules

&gt;&gt;<i> a good set of options.  The NO framework uses a fieldOrder() method that
</I>returns a comma-separated list of field names.  I've never liked this much,
since it isn't type-safe.  But it is useful to have the information in the
POJO because the information is right there in the class that your editing.
In practice it is the domain programmer who deals with such relatively minor
GUI issues.

&gt;&gt;<i> My preference is for (a) initially, with eventually (c) so that a user
</I>can override (a) with their own preferences.  (b) really doesn't appeal for
the reasons I described in the previous post - it spreads out the
information and makes the domain programmer have to worry about XML-y
things.


---
Lets look at grouping (either literally with an SWT Group or in an
Expandable Composite), options are:
a) grouping is built into the domain model and it represents this by say
passing a third array column with the name of the group to put the
string into
b) the GUI looks for an xml-based IGroupAdapter which return the fields
in smaller, named arrays, one for each group
c) The GUI is user-configurable as before
d) The GUI starts being clever - if the domain model presents Strings it
just display them; if it presents a struct or javabean, it automatically
groups them.

&gt;&gt;<i> This is a more interesting one.  In fact, it's wrong to think of grouping
</I>as a GUI concern.  Q: what sort of things would get grouped?  A: things that
go together.  For example, the UI for a Customer object might have a &quot;Name&quot;
group might consist of (title/firstname/lastname/suffix).

&gt;&gt;<i> But here's the point: apply Eric Evans' Ubiquitous Language principle.
</I>If there's such a thing as a &quot;Name&quot;, then it should be in the domain model.
So we should say that the Customer class has an immutable composition
(&quot;aggregation by value&quot;) 1:1 relationship with Name.  This domain
information is all that the UI component needs.  We can then have a
collapsible group in the Customer's form that when collapsed shows the
Name's toString (&quot;Mr. John Daniels&quot;) and when opened up shows the
constituent fields and allows them to be edited.  The same use of
relationships for a 1:M relationship should allow Order/Order-Details to be
shown on a single form.

&gt;&gt;<i> These are some of the lessons we've learnt from the Irish DSFA gig.
</I>Because the NO framework's viewer isn't really all that sophisticated, we've
had to work harder at finding a way to express the information within the
domain model.  The Name class I quoted is one that from the DSFA.  Another
example is DateOfBirth (the date, a date verified flag, and a date
verification source lookup).  Finding ways to represent this info within the
domain object means that one can also start to put &quot;know-how-to&quot;
responsibilities into these objects (eg Name#change, or
DateOfBirth#verifyUsingSource).  It also - I would argue - makes the domain
model better than it otherwise would have been: UI grouping really is the
sign that analysis has been mislocated at the UI layer rather than the
domain layer.


---
Of course all of these are variations on the same processing, I am just
talking about where responsibility lies.  My problem is that I see the
repsonsibility ending up in several places - a generally bad outcome.
On the one hand some data is core to the domain model so should be there
- the name of the field presented to the user for one.  However other
stuff makes more sense in the GUI configuration - is a date field
represented by a text box with validation or a calender widget?

&gt;&gt;<i> I would say that every date field should be rendered the same way.  If
</I>there's a reason why a date in one class should be rendered one way, and a
date in another class should be rendered another, then there is probably
some difference in domain semantics.  Find a way to capture that information
in the domain model.

&gt;&gt;<i> To make this concrete, suppose a regular Date is rendered as a text box
</I>and we choose this as our default rendering.  However, an Appointment's date
(which the users conceptually think as occuring on a Calendar) should be
rendered using a drop-down calendar widget.  In this case, I would suggest
creating a value object subclass of Date called something like CalendarDate,
and have my Appointment use this.  (This is probably so common that
rcpviewer should ship a library of these values with defined semantics for
domain programmers to choose from).

&gt;&gt;<i> As ever, hope some of the above makes sense....
</I>

I'm jealous.  I don't have GUI tests for our product, I have only 
JUnit-based functional tests.  What do you use for GUI testing?

</I>

My personal preference is to have just one application-wide toolbar.  I 
prefer the 'one stop shopping' that the main toolbar affords me.  I 
don't like to have to scan the screen for the toolbar with the button 
that I want.
In our application I have several toolbar buttons that always stay on 
the toolbar; Save, Refresh, Print, etc.
Editor actions are added to the main toolbar as the active editor 
changes.  I use eclipse extension points exclusively to manage the main 
menu and toolbar.  I like that I don't have any code in my editors to 
manage menus, toolbars, or context menus.


That said, I don't know what the 'right' thing is.  I think the 'right' 
approach would be the approach that would score highest on usability 
tests, but I don't have a feel for which approach that is.

---------------------
Given that we have different preferences perhaps the answer is that the 
GUI should be configurable to use either approach.
You could implement your spike to use the editor toolbar and then I 
could research how to dynamically switch between using editor toolbars 
and the application toolbar.

-------------------
OR.... perhaps the answer is that the domain object should specify 
whether the action should go on the editor toolbar or the application 
toolbar.
If the domain object does not specify which toolbar to use then the GUI 
should use the 'default' toolbar.
The 'default' toolbar could be configurable.  Some developers might 
prefer to make the application toolbar the default toolbar and some 
developers would prefer to use the editor toolbar as the default.

<PRE>Hi All,

Those of you that love really long e-mails are gonna love this one ;-)....

I'm at the point where I'm ready to write code that will open an EMF 
object in an Editor, specifically an RCPViewerEditor. 
An Eclipse editor must be supplied with an instance of IEditorInput when 
the editor is opened.
Among other things IEditorInput must implement these three methods...

    /**
     * Returns the image descriptor for this input.
     */
    public ImageDescriptor getImageDescriptor();

    /**
     * Returns the name of this editor input for display purposes.
     */
    public String getName();

    /**
     * Returns the tool tip text for this editor input. 
     */
    public String getToolTipText();


These three items are 'extra' properties, for the UI only, and are not 
normally part of a domain object model.
NO requires methods to be added to the domain model to supply this 
information.  Actually, that's one aspect of NO that I don't care for, I 
don't think that an object model should have to be polluted with this 
information.  I'm not sure how the POJO version of NO gets this information.
I've taken a look at the classes in the EMF-Builder project and I didn't 
see anything that would get me this information.

So, here is my proposal... I have introduced a new interface, 
IRcpViewerMetadata that provides the viewer with access to this information.
As is my usual modis operandi,  I use the Eclipse AdapterManager to get 
an IRcpViewerMetadata from any object.  So, when I need an object's 
metadata I do this...

    IRcpViewerMetadata metadata= (IRcpViewerMetadata)
        
Platform.getAdapterManager().getAdapter(IRcpViewerMetadata.class, 
anyEObject);

------------------------------

So, instead of modifying the domain model and adding classes that 
specify this information I have chosen to put this information into an 
XML file and register this file in an extension point, 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.metadata.
The metadata extension element points to a file with the XML metadata in it.
So, in the plugin that defines the PurchaseOrder class I have this 
extension element in the plugin.xml...

&lt;extension point=&quot;de.berlios.rcpviewer.metadata&quot;&gt;
    &lt;metadata class=&quot;com.example.ppo.PurchaseOrder&quot; 
xml=&quot;PurchaseOrder.rvm&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;

Then, when the de.berlios.rcpviewer starts up it rips through all the 
de.berlios.rcpviewer.metadata extensions and, for every metadata 
element  in an extension, registers an adapter factory that can supply 
an instance of IRcpViewerMetadata given an object that implements the 
interface named in the metadata's 'class' element.  The 
de.berlios.rcpviewer reads the denoted XML file to get the metadata.

Make sense so far?

------------------------------

Here is the best part...

I have modeled the IRcpViewerMetadata in EMF.  Right out of the box I 
have an editor for creating/editing metadata.  The default EMF.Edit 
editor lets me save the metadata as XML (Ecore  XML).  The EMF framework 
gives me tools to load the XML as a IRcpViewerMetadata object. 

Since IRcpViewerMetadata is an Ecore object then when the RCPViewer is 
completed it will be possible to edit RCPViewer metadata information 
using the RCPViewer itself.

But wait!  There's more! 
Have you seen the default EMF model editor?  EMF has a default model 
editor for creating and editing Ecore models.  This is possible because 
ECore itself is expressed as a model that the EMF.Edit framework can use 
to generate an editor.
So....the EMF.Edit framework can be used to a) create models (that is, 
model the application), and then b) used in the application itself to 
create/edit objects.

Following the same pattern as EMF.Edit, if we model the RCPViewer 
metadata as ECore objects then the RCPViewer will be able to a) model an 
application, and then b) run the application.
It would even be possible to open an application's metadata from within 
the application, change the metadata, and then restart to apply the changes!
Cool or what!

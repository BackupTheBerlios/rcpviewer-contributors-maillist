<PRE>The spike was designed for clarity rather than functionality - it was 
more of a demo than a technology investigation.  How clear it remains 
once we want it to do real things is another matter...  Nevertheless, 
thankyou Ted!

OK - next steps.
If we want the spike to be the base, two preparatory steps are required:
- rewrite it for a test driven approach
- use Dan's metamodel.
I suggest I do this asap.  That will be next Friday (3rd June) as I will 
be on a client site until Thursday completing my monthly release cycle. 
  However, as I reward to myself I have shaded in all of that Friday for 
RcpViewer.
Once this is done we can divide up into the different areas as suggested 
by Ted.  Regarding Ted's ideas:
- peristence: I have not given any thought to persistence so am happy to 
offer someone else that opportunity...
- expand default viewer : I quite fancy that
- sample metamodel : Dan?  As a thought, how complex is the Java 
Petstore  model?
- validation functionality : part of the model spec surely?

My other idea relates to Ted's discussion about his EMF plans. 
Interestingly, he has identified the same risks as I have wrt to small 
company software development - though his proposed solutions are bolder 
than mine (I am relying on the plugin concept and auto-updates).

The DDUI is obviously RcpViewer as we all understand it.  It is 
essentially an enabler for what he terms the 'active object model'.  Now 
if this model is static with respect to any single runtime instance (i.e 
generated once at startup) surely it is effectively the same thing as 
Dan is working on?  In which case can we not define a single contract / 
interface that the DDUI works against and 'on the other side' allow Ted 
and Dan to explore different ways of implementing that contract?  That 
would give us a clear division of work.
- Ted : model impl 1
- Dan : model impl 2
- Ted / Dan : agree common contract
- Mike : develop first client for this contract (gui)
- ? : develop second client for this contract (persistence)
I see the core work of this project actually being the generation of 
this contract - which will be the richer if it is developed in 
conjunction with multiple implementations.

Perhaps this is too much duplication for a small team - but perhaps a 
period of parallel, cooperative development would offer a better long 
term result?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can think of a few general areas of expansion...
</I>&gt;<i> ...add persistence to mikespike3.
</I>&gt;<i> ...expand the default viewer layout capability
</I>&gt;<i> ...create a sample metamodel for development purposes
</I>&gt;<i> ...add validation functionality to mikespike3
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be willing to work on any of the above.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest that we create an official code branch from Mike's code.
</I>&gt;<i> Then each new capability should be developed as a 'spike'. Then, after 
</I>&gt;<i> the group has reviewed and approved a spike the new functionality be 
</I>&gt;<i> merged into the official code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> About my spike (or lack thereof)...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am motivated to work on RCPViewer because I am trying to put together 
</I>&gt;<i> the technical architecture for a next generation Java ERP, basically the 
</I>&gt;<i> core architecture for the next generation of RPCSoftware's product.
</I>&gt;<i> I have identified several key things that our product really needs in 
</I>&gt;<i> order to be more successful (actually, these are things that I consider 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to stay in business long term, otherwise the costs of 
</I>&gt;<i> developing, deploying, and managing systems will grow far beyond what 
</I>&gt;<i> small businesses can pay for).
</I>&gt;<i> Two of those things are...
</I>&gt;<i> ...an Active Object Model.  We need to be able to more easily customize 
</I>&gt;<i> the product for specific customers, an active object model is key to 
</I>&gt;<i> being able to do this in a managable way.
</I>&gt;<i> ...a DDUI (Domain-Driven User Interface).  We need to find a way to 
</I>&gt;<i> dramatically reduce the effort it takes to develop a good quality UI.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> hope RCPViewer will be the answer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I think I came to RCPViewer from a different perspective than most.  
</I>&gt;<i> I need a DDUI that display objects from a domain model that is not 
</I>&gt;<i> determined until runtime.  Whereas for most everybody else the domain 
</I>&gt;<i> model is determined at compile time.  This is why I started with EMF.  
</I>&gt;<i> EMF will be the basis of my active object model.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, my original thought was that RCPViewer would be a viewer for EMF 
</I>&gt;<i> objects.  That there would be an adapter to provide EMF-metadata for POJOs.
</I>&gt;<i> However, EMF is proving to be fairly cumbersome.  After seeing Mike's 
</I>&gt;<i> spike I can't see why RCPViewer should use EMF when the job can get done 
</I>&gt;<i> in a much simpler fashion.
</I>&gt;<i> So,  I intend to finish my spike because I MUST learn the ins and outs 
</I>&gt;<i> of EMF and I MUST have a DDUI that can display object instances from my 
</I>&gt;<i> active object model.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I not convinced that EMF is the best base on which to build 
</I>&gt;<i> RCPViewer.
</I>&gt;<i> After finishing my spike I will investigate how to use Mike's spike to 
</I>&gt;<i> view EMF-generated object instances.

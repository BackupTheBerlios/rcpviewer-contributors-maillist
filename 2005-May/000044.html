That's correct, I'm trying to produce an example application without 
adding ANY, or a little as possible, extra metadata or decorations since 
I know that there will be MANY discussions to come about that stuff.
So, consider this screenshot to be what an RCPViewer application would 
be like if a developer displayed a domain object with only the bare 
minimum amount of required metadata.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be a little more concrete let's take for a simple example, ordering 
</I>&gt;<i> String fields in an editor.  Let's assume the metamodel provide the 
</I>&gt;<i> GUI with an 2D array of field names and values (I know, I know - it 
</I>&gt;<i> will be cleverer than that, but this is illustrative).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So options that occur to me are:
</I>&gt;<i> a) the sort order is built into the metamodel which sort the array 
</I>&gt;<i> from annotation values on the domain POJO's.
</I>&gt;<i> b) GUI checks for an ISortAdapter which if found first re-sorts the 
</I>&gt;<i> array as per its ( xml-based..?) configuration
</I>&gt;<i> c) the GUI is user-configurable presenting the user with a default 
</I>&gt;<i> list and then allowing items to be moved up and down - it then 
</I>&gt;<i> remembers this order for all future instances (this is sort of like 
</I>&gt;<i> the old Lotus Notes interface)
</I>&gt;<i> d) the GUI applies it own hard-coded rules
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lets look at grouping (either literally with an SWT Group or in an 
</I>&gt;<i> Expandable Composite), options are:
</I>&gt;<i> a) grouping is built into the domain model and it represents this by 
</I>&gt;<i> say passing a third array column with the name of the group to put the 
</I>&gt;<i> string into
</I>&gt;<i> b) the GUI looks for an xml-based IGroupAdapter which return the 
</I>&gt;<i> fields in smaller, named arrays, one for each group
</I>&gt;<i> c) The GUI is user-configurable as before
</I>&gt;<i> d) The GUI starts being clever - if the domain model presents Strings 
</I>&gt;<i> it just display them; if it presents a struct or javabean, it 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically groups them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course all of these are variations on the same processing, I am 
</I>&gt;<i> just talking about where responsibility lies.  My problem is that I 
</I>&gt;<i> see the repsonsibility ending up in several places - a generally bad 
</I>&gt;<i> outcome. On the one hand some data is core to the domain model so 
</I>&gt;<i> should be there - the name of the field presented to the user for 
</I>&gt;<i> one.  However other stuff makes more sense in the GUI configuration - 
</I>&gt;<i> is a date field represented by a text box with validation or a 
</I>&gt;<i> calender widget?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Actually, I would lean towards putting most all extra data item required 
to construct the GUI in the GUI metadata layer. 
Consider for instance your single example of data that is core to the 
domain model, the name of the field presented to the user.  I would use 
the name of the field from the domain model as a default value that 
could be overwritten in the metadata layer since the label might need to 
be internationalized (or even customized per client, for instance, we 
have some clients that refer to customer orders as 'Orders' while other 
clients prefer to refer to them as 'Projects').

Actually, I consider the ECore API to provide a definition of what is 
'core' to the domain model.  If it's available via the ECore API then 
it's in the domain model otherwise everything else is in the GUI metamodel.

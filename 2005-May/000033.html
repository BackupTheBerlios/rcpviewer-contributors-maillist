<PRE>Hi Mike,

You are right, there was definitely some junk in SVN as a result of me
refactoring and moving classes around.  It wasn't there on my local
workspace, and subclipse reported everything sync'ed up.  So either a bug in
subclipse, or (equally likely) me not using the plugin in the way its
designers intended.

So, I moved my local workspace off to one side, then did a complete refresh
with tortoisesvn.  Then did a compare of the two directories, and located
the junk.  Then zapped with tortoisesvn and commited.

Have loaded eclipse against this new workspace; all tests are now passing.

So, if you refresh to head (or revision 114 or thereabouts), then you should
be able to get a clean compile.

---
To answer your other points:
- DomainClassRegistry I've now renamed to MetaModel.  That's because it has
an additional responsibilities of looking after IMetaModelExtensions -
things that parse the POJO classes looking for additional semantics.
- happy with your suggestion on the programming style.  If you're feeling
proactive and want to do an export of your favourite settings, please upload
into somewhere sensible on SVN and document on t'wiki.

---
Also, I've moved the 3 empty folders that were languishing directly under
rcpviewer/ into rcpviewer/trunk/spikes/mikes-workspace.  I guess they got
created when you were messing around with SVN (I know it took me a little
experimentation to figure things out).

Cheers - and sorry you didn't get to play with emf-builder earlier on today.

Dan

Dan,

Trying to look at your emf-builder, some issues with (perhaps old? or
conversely not up to date ) classes.

* what has happened to DomainClassRegistry?

* either I have not set up my SVN properly and am importing deleted
classes or we have have a conflict/ambiguity, eg:
     de.berlios.rcpviewer.metamodel.DomainObject
     de.berlios.rcpviewer.progmodel.standard.DomainObject


* can I suggets setting 'java / code style / number of imports needed
for *' at 9999 - in this day and age of auto-folding editors, having
long import lists is not a problem - and much more helpful for resolving
class ambiguities such as the above (if you're happoy with this I'll add
it to Project Standards)

* TestDomainClass testing non-existent methods.

* I have made some very minor typo corrections / clarifications to
Index.wiki &amp; committed (NO OTHER commits done)

Mike E.

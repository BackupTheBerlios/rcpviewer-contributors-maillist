<PRE>Hi All,

I'm impressed by Mike's last spike.  It's easy to understand and 
straightforward.  I think it's a good base on which to move forward with 
RCPViewer.
At this point I still intend to finish my spike (more on that below, 
that's optional reading ;-)) but I don't want to muddy the waters with 
my spike.  I can see that Mike's spike is a much better base on which to 
move forward than mine will be.

So that said, assuming that we move forward with Mike's spike, what are 
the next steps? 

I think it would be good to come up with several orthogonal areas of 
expansion that could be worked on separately by different developers.

I can think of a few general areas of expansion...
...add persistence to mikespike3.
...expand the default viewer layout capability
...create a sample metamodel for development purposes
...add validation functionality to mikespike3

I would be willing to work on any of the above.

I suggest that we create an official code branch from Mike's code.
Then each new capability should be developed as a 'spike'. 
Then, after the group has reviewed and approved a spike the new 
functionality be merged into the official code.


----------------------------------------

About my spike (or lack thereof)...

I am motivated to work on RCPViewer because I am trying to put together 
the technical architecture for a next generation Java ERP, basically the 
core architecture for the next generation of RPCSoftware's product.
I have identified several key things that our product really needs in 
order to be more successful (actually, these are things that I consider 
necessary to stay in business long term, otherwise the costs of 
developing, deploying, and managing systems will grow far beyond what 
small businesses can pay for).
Two of those things are...
...an Active Object Model.  We need to be able to more easily customize 
the product for specific customers, an active object model is key to 
being able to do this in a managable way.
...a DDUI (Domain-Driven User Interface).  We need to find a way to 
dramatically reduce the effort it takes to develop a good quality UI.  I 
hope RCPViewer will be the answer.

So, I think I came to RCPViewer from a different perspective than most.  
I need a DDUI that display objects from a domain model that is not 
determined until runtime.  Whereas for most everybody else the domain 
model is determined at compile time.  This is why I started with EMF.  
EMF will be the basis of my active object model.

So, my original thought was that RCPViewer would be a viewer for EMF 
objects.  That there would be an adapter to provide EMF-metadata for POJOs.
However, EMF is proving to be fairly cumbersome.  After seeing Mike's 
spike I can't see why RCPViewer should use EMF when the job can get done 
in a much simpler fashion.
So,  I intend to finish my spike because I MUST learn the ins and outs 
of EMF and I MUST have a DDUI that can display object instances from my 
active object model.
However, I not convinced that EMF is the best base on which to build 
RCPViewer.
After finishing my spike I will investigate how to use Mike's spike to 
view EMF-generated object instances.

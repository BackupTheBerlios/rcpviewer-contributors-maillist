I am happy to add a persistence aspect to the example.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Same here, I planned on relying on plugins and auto-updates.  The 
biggest problem is when we must customize the domain model for a client 
by adding new attributes and associates to existing classes.  There is 
significant variation in how our clients run their businesses.  Our 
model is becoming polluted by all these additions made only for specific 
clients. 
Also, there is the problem of customizing forms to display data that is 
specific to a client.  We currently add new fields to a common form that 
is shared by all our clients.  It irritates existing clients that new 
fields are showing up on forms, fields that they don't understand and 
don't care about. 
I suppose that the GUI aspect of customizing forms for clients could be 
handled via some plugin-based scheme, however the active model coupled 
with a DDUI seems like it solves a whole bunch of problems  at once 
(avoids domain model polution by adding new attributes at runtime via a 
plugin extension to the domain model, domain driven forms automagically 
accomodate the extended domain, more consistent and higher quality UI, 
and the real payoff... much less work required to maintain and develop 
new functionality).



&gt;<i> The DDUI is obviously RcpViewer as we all understand it.  It is 
</I>&gt;<i> essentially an enabler for what he terms the 'active object model'.  
</I>&gt;<i> Now if this model is static with respect to any single runtime

</I>&gt;<i> single contract / interface that the DDUI works against and 'on the 
</I>&gt;<i> other side' allow Ted and Dan to explore different ways of 
</I>&gt;<i> implementing that contract?  That would give us a clear division of 
</I>&gt;<i> work. e
</I>
I agree.  Dan's model is 'THE' model.  Different implementation of the 
model are used for POJO development versus EMF development. 
This is one point that I was trying to get at in my last e-mail about 
why Mike's spike is more appropriate for a base going forward.  My spike 
is based on EMF-generated objects, Mike's spike is based on POJOs.  Most 
developers will use POJOs therefore Mike's spike is more appropriate for 
developing RCPViewer.  My spike respresents an exceptional case, 
therefore I should adapt my domain objects to work with Mike's spike.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps this is too much duplication for a small team - but perhaps a 
</I>&gt;<i> period of parallel, cooperative development would offer a better long

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Perhaps too much duplication.  Not really sure. 
The changes that each of us make are gonna be BIG.  So I figure that 
even if we agree to work on a single example that basically merging the 
changes together will come down to each of using rewriting the examples 
that we work on anyway.

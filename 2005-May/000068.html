<PRE>My third little spike is complete.
It suggests a base mechanism for GUI generation.
For review - most of the info is in the wiki page whose content I attach 
below to save a download of the whole spike.

1 Mike's Spike 3

This is a real spike - no more hand holding.
Its aim is to provoke thought into the basic mechanism (I hesitate to 
call it architecture) for GUI generation within RcpViewer.
Principles are:
* KISS
* eat your own dog food
* extensibility
* principle of no surprises (for RCP developers anyway)
A lot more thought than code has gone into this spike...

~~Limitations~~
* Only thinking about presentation here - not any other functionality.
* Still not using EMF model as a distraction

~~Set Up~~
mikespike3 represents the core RcpViewer code as delieverd by us. It is 
based on the mikespike2 code with the following (initial) differences:
* packages have been juggled (I like juggling packages)
* 'God' singleton has been swapped for rather more tasteful 'Model'
* this deals with instances for the puposes of this spike, not types
* the model starts with simple bean classes holding random primitive values
* the start-up view (ObjectListView) is now a list of all __instances__ 
within the model
* no tests - this is a real spike
mikespike3-acme represents a plugin developed by a third party extending 
RcpViewer.

A launch configuration for mikespike3 can be easily created using the 
'Launch an Eclipse Application' option on the overview tab of the plugin 
editor.  Once you have run the vanilla options add the mikespike3-acme 
plugin for its extra goodies (such as they are).

~~ Design ~~
There is a single, final mikespike3.editors.Editor class.  All displayed 
editors within RcpViewer are instances of this class.  Why?  I feel 
tying in persistence / security / all other non-GUI functionality to the 
Eclipse platform will be non-trivial.  Even if all of these are 
implemented vai aspects  we will still have to tie them in with GUI - 
editor lifecycle, save option enablements etc. etc.  Having a base 
editor which we do not have to open up for subclassing will keep life 
simple.

So how are different GUI representations generated?  Via 
mikespike3.gui.IEditorContentBuilder.  This is an interface and an 
extension point.  The Editor's mikespike3.editors.EditorInput passes a 
builder of this type that is then called in the Editor's 
createPartControl(...) method to generate the GUI.  The EditorInput is 
populated by whatever GUI mechanism the user is using to open an editor. 
  Here this is demonstrated by the two mikespike3.views.OpenAction's 
actions.  These reference a singleton 
mikespike3.gui.EditorContentBuilderFactory for available options.

Exactly what IEditorContentBuilder options are available are decided on 
a per class basis via the isApplicable() method on each interface.  The 
java implementation decides this rather than a configuration value to 
enable flexibility - in the longer term I reckon applicability should be 
done per instance rather than per type.  Plus having potentially complex 
logic rules in XML is daft.

Note that I follow the standard Eclipse approach of offering a default 
Editor for any particular type (dbl-click or 'open' menu option) or a 
list of other options via the 'open with' menu option.  Whatever option 
is selected becomes the default for that type).

All of this is to allow third parties to develop additional editor GUI 
representations for RcpViewer.

However I propose that we develop just one.  This is 
mikespike3.gui.DefaultEditorContentBuilder which generates a form-based 
GUI for any type based on the model metadata.  (Currently the 
implementation does the basic reflection necessary but of course this 
will comes from Dan's RCP model).

Developing only a single content builder is not as limited as it sounds. 
It uses the Composite patern to build up the GUI field-by-field.  The 
GUI for each individual field is then generated via a 
mikespike3.gui.IFieldBuilder implementation.  This is also an extension 
point and implementation selection works in a similiar manner to 
IEditorContentBuilder - with two crucial differences:
* IFieldBuilder's are selected per instance, not per type;
* IEditorContentBuilder offer alternatives whilst a single IFieldBuilder 
  will be always be selected
Hence the FieldBuilderFactory runs through all implementations of the 
'mikespike3.fieldbuilder' extension point until it hits the first that 
isApplicable().  If none are found it reverts to the 
DefaultFieldBuilder.  Note that the extension points are sorted so that 
more specialist ones are checked first.  What does 'more specialist' 
mean? - see ConfigElementSorter in the util package (this is an old 
implemenation that might be more elegantly done in Eclipse 3.x).

The purpose of the IFieldBuilder mechanism is to allow very different 
GUI's to be generated in the same editor.  Whilst the examples within 
this spike are trivial, in RcpViewer different IFieldBuilder's for 
linked objects based on their relationships will offer rich 
alternatives.  Or so I shall try to prove in the next spike.

--------
&gt;<i>   public Order placeOrderDefaults(Date[] d) {  // framework will pass in a
</I>&gt;<i>1-element array
</I>&gt;<i>     d[0] = yesterdaysDate();                   // typesafe
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>I don't understand why the placeOrderDefaults method returns an Order
object instead of just returning an array of defaults for the placeOrder
method.

That is, I would have expected this instead...

  public Object[] getPlaceOrderDefaults() { return new Object[] {
  yesterdaysDate() }; }


&gt;&gt;<i> first up, actually I made a mistake, in that the placeOrderDefaults(...)
</I>would probably just be void rather than return null.

&gt;&gt;<i> other than that, I think I prefer my approach because (a) it's easy to
</I>copy-and-paste the original method and then just append &quot;[]&quot; to the end of
each method, and (b) it's typesafe in a way that returning a array of
Objects isn't.

&gt;&gt;<i> any other opinions???
</I>

----
I would prefer the placeOrderPreConditions method to throw a checked
exception.  The aspect that invokes the placeOrderPreConditions method
can always rethrow a RuntimeException that wraps the exception thrown by
the placeOrderPreConditions method.

&gt;&gt;<i> Okay, I buy that.  That is a more natural way to go.
</I>

----
A thought...
since you envision an aspect calling the placeOrderPreConditions method
anyway then why not just put the code for the placeOrderPreConditions
method in an aspect?

It kinda makes sense to me to that &quot;defaults&quot; and &quot;pre conditions&quot; are
aspects of the system that could be implemented separately from the
domain model.

&gt;&gt;<i> Don't agree here.  Preconditions are part of the semantics of a domain
</I>model so should be expressed in it.  Since we aren't writing Eiffel, this is
the most natural way I can think of.  And while we might use aspects for our
own implementation, I don't want to force the use of aspects on regular
domain programmers.


----
The advantage of such would be that a domain model could be reused in
systems that have different requirements in terms of default and
preconditions.  Or even better... different defaults and pre conditions
could be 'woven' into a system at runtime.

&gt;&gt;<i> Now *that* is a very interesting idea.  What it says to me is that rather
</I>than relying on a naming convention (append &quot;PreConditions&quot;, one would
instead use some more extensible mechanism to indicate preconditions.
Actually, this does sound a little like aspects, though.

&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe the commonly trodden path should just be the &quot;PreConditions&quot;
</I>suffix, but we do (he says, contradicting himself) provide some abstract
aspects so that more sophisticated domain programmers can easily attach
additional preconditions if they so choose.  In fact, we should then eat our
own dog food so that my &quot;apply PreConditions&quot; aspect is just the first of
those).

&gt;&gt;<i> Anyone else want to contribute on this thread?
</I>

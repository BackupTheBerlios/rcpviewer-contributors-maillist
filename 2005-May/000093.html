</I>Subclassing doesn't work when more than one subclass is required.
For instance, suppose a particular client needs time-tracking in 
addition to the standard functionality.  The time-tracking module wants 
to subclass the Vendor class to create an Employee class.  An Employee 
is a Vendor that provides a service and that also has a 'Pay Rate' that 
determines the cost of the empoyee's service.
Also suppose that the same client needs to track the Tax Id of Vendors, 
which is not part of the standard functionality (this is a real case but 
I don't recall right now what the vendor's Tax Id is used for).  So a 
customization module is create for the client that subclasses the Vendor 
class and adds the Tax ID to the Vendor.

Now, how do I create a Vendor at runtime?  I can create either the 
subclass used by the time-tracking module, or the subclass used by the 
client plugin. 

I figure that the answer is to use composition instead of subclass so 
that the two modules can add what they need to the Vendor class at 
runtime.  An 'active' object model would give me that.

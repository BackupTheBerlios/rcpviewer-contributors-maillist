In my previous post I documented the thought process that lead to my
insight.
I think that you should have something like that process in your NO
documentation.
That is, instead of just saying &quot;All NO objects must implement these
methods....&quot; you should lead a new developer through the thought process
that enables them to erase the difference in thier mind between
configuring/building a GUI versus having the domain supply the data
necessary to 'connect' a GUI to the object.  That might help popularize
the NO approach.


&gt;&gt;<i> Good idea.  I've started a docbook XML doc anyway which I hope to evolve
</I>into a developer's guide.  So I've just put a few stub sections to capture
this thought.  (Formal docs are to live under SVN/trunk/docs, by the
ay).  -- Dan

Now I understand that post.  I guess I was not 'getting' it before.
I suppose that one critisism of the NO framework that you have heard a
lot is that NO requires stuff to be in the domain model that should
really not be in the domain model.
This will be a frequent critisism of developers that have not had the
'aha' moment that I had today.

In my previous post I documented the thought process that lead to my
insight.

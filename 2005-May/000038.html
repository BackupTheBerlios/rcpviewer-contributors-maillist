<PRE>Ted,
posted a comment up on your screenshot on the wiki:
<A HREF="http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/comments/ted/What+I+think+the+">http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/comments/ted/What+I+think+the+</A>
RCP+Viewer+could+look+like...#comment-ted/What%20I%20think%20the%20RCP%20Vie
wer%20could%20look%20like...-1

But to save you a click, and to cultivate discussion, let me also
copy-and-paste it here:

[comment]
I think there's some excellent ideas here - and some things that I like
somewhat less.  (But you were after feedback, weren't you?)

I think the Navigator view looks very nice.  Nice and clean.  Perhaps &quot;List&quot;
should be &quot;Search&quot; - in practical terms one wouldn't want to have a list of
every Customer.

Not nearly so sure about the main view.  While I think that it would be fine
to have individual views that hold either then left hand side tree or the
right-hand side properties, it doesn't (I'm afraid) cut it to me as having
anywhere near the level of sophistication for typical end-users.  I did some
street testing on the wife and in-laws - they agree I'm afraid.

What I am aiming for is something with the sophistication of Mike's RCP app
(eg <A HREF="http://www.incremental.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/screenshots/marketing.png">http://www.incremental.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/screenshots/marketing.png</A>)
or Schoolclipse
(<A HREF="https://schoolclipse.dev.java.net/files/documents/2161/10318/Clip2.gif">https://schoolclipse.dev.java.net/files/documents/2161/10318/Clip2.gif</A>) or
Xinity (<A HREF="http://www.xinity.org/?About/Xinity%20BASE">http://www.xinity.org/?About/Xinity%20BASE</A>).  Ultimately I'd like
UIs with the sophistication of MS Outlook or equivalent.

So I'm sorry that the above sounds a little negative.  But let me finish on
a high note, which is the Actions tab.  I've been wondering where an
object's actions might live, but I think that the Actions tab is just
wonderful.  It also reminds me of the left-hand side bar in Windows'
Explorer, eg the Search bar or the Write CD bar.  One could have the
parameters for each such action be exposed  as one clicks on the action.
This also has the benefit that the actions are not modal, a definite plus
point.  So thanks - I'm really pleased with that idea.

Mike/Eoin - any thoughts?

Dan

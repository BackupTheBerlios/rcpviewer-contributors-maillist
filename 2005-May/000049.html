I like Mike's screenshot of the Customer view a lot.
Ultimately I would like the Properties pane in my application to look
like that.

However, a single view like Mike's customer view would not work for many
of the objects our application displays (my guess is that the Customer
view doesn't work well for all of the objects that Epic displays either).
Here's why...consider an order that has hundred's or thousands of line
items on it.  In terms of Mike's Customer view, consider how that view
would work if the Customer has a thousand Contacts ...

&gt;&gt;<i> That's true enough, but then again just because there is a 1:m
</I>relationship from Customer to Contacts, it doesn't mean that there is
navigability from Customer -&gt; Contacts.

&gt;&gt;<i> Eric Evans makes the case that we should look to constrain the
</I>navigability of associations (DDD, pp82-87).  I would argue that the size of
a collection of related objects is a part of that building a good domain
model.  At the DSFA (Pensions payments) there is an object called
PensionScheme, which has a collection of Payment objects.  Now, there is one
Payment per week, and a pensioner could claim for 30 years or more.  That
makes 1500 related Payments.  The design we came up with was to hold the 20
most recent Payments, and to have the icon representing the collection
provide a mechanism to query archived Payments.  We are using Evans'
Repository pattern (DDD pp147-157) to abstract the domain objects from the
archive database.

&gt;&gt;<i> So, in summary, if you're trying to let the user navigate through 1000
</I>objects, you've probably got the navigability in the domain model wrong.  At
the very least some sort of filtering or querying facility is needed, either
client-side (resolve the collection and filter in a table) or server-side
(run a query from a user action).



---
So, to solve these problems I think an outline pane is neccessary.  The
outline  view affords  the user with 'context' about their current
location within a large object tree and it also provides for easier
navigation within the object.
The outline pane could be optional.

Also, the Eclipse IDE put the outline in a view that is separate from
the editors.  I chose to put the outline inside the editor in a separate
pane inside the editor ... I didn't want to waste the screen real estate
an an outline view that
wouldn't be used all the time.

&gt;&gt;<i> I think I'd argue that the outline pane is important enough to warrant
</I>its own view.  That said, I was thinking more that it would be combined with
a navigator-like view, so that all instantied objects in the client-side
session could be viewed and explored - possibly recursively.  But this is a
relatively minor point in the scheme of things.

<PRE>Hi all,

This is an overview of how I intend to implement persistence and of 
changes that I would make to the API with regard to peristence.
Please read this and provide feedback soon in order to prevent me from 
persuing a path that you would rather I not persue ;-).

I expect that each application will handle persistence in its own way.  
Some applications may use Hibernate, some may save objects as XML in a 
file system, etc.
As I see it it, RCPViewer should not have any API to actually *perform* 
persistence, RCPViewer merely needs a way to hook up peristence objects 
to the GUI.

As I see it, these items are what RCPViewer needs with regard to 
peristence...

...Support for 'New' actions.  That is, something similar to 'New 
Wizards' in the RCP. 
So, for instance, to create a new Customer the user should just be able 
to select File | New | Customer from the main menu and an editor should 
open for entering the Customer information.
In order to implement this I propose adding a new method to IDomainClass 
named isNewable().  isNewable() returns true if the class should be 
included on the File | New menu.  The default value is false.

... Editor support for Save, SaveAs methods and support for the 'dirty' 
decoration in the editor tab.  Every IDomainObject is displayed in it's 
own editor.  The RCPViewer editor must implement the 
org.eclipse.ui.ISaveablePart interface.  I propose that editor should 
simply delegate ISaveablePart  methods to the underlying IDomainObject. 
Therefore I propose that IDomainObjects that IDomainObject extends the 
org.eclipse.ui.ISaveablePart interface
(NOTE: This ties IDomainObject to an Eclipse API.  Is this a bad thing?  
Is the de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain API really meant for generic 
development?  Or just Eclipse development?  Personally, I have no 
problem with tying IDomainObject to Eclipse but what do you guys think?)

----------------

Assuming all of the above os OK then the next question is how do I 
create an implementation of the RCPViewer API that uses POJOs?
The simple answer would be to require high level POJOs that are 
'newable' to implement the org.eclipse.ui.ISaveablePart interface. 
However, if we require POJOs to implement a specific interface then 
they're not really POJOs anymore are they?

I think that Dan's answer would be to add the ISaveablePart interface to 
a class as a mixin, using AspectJ or something.

My answer is to provider POJO classes that are 'newable' with an Eclipse 
adapter factory that can adapt POJO instances that are saveable to 
implementations of ISaveablePart.


----------------
BTW, I would have suggested integrating RCPView with the Eclipse 'New 
Wizard' functionality but I have found that the 'New Wizards' 
functionality isn't exactly suitable for RCPViewer.  The problem with 
Eclipse 'New Wizards' is that they REQUIRE a wizard page to be shown for 
whatever object you are creating.  However, most time I expect that 
creating objects will not require any kind of configuration before the 
object is created.
So, for instance, to create a new Customer the user should just be able 
to select File | New | Customer from the main menu and an editor should 
open for entering the Customer information.
However, this cannot be implemented with the Eclipse New Wizard 
functionality.  The Eclipse New Wizard functionality REQUIRES that a 
wizard be displayed when the user chooses File | New | Customer from the 
main menu, then the Customer editor is displayed when the user hits the 
FINISH button on the wizard.

---------------
NOTE: I don't see any need for the IObjectStore interface in the 
RCPViewer API.

---------------

Anyway, I will create a simple axmple of these ideas from mikespike3 and 
hopefully post it in a couple/few days.

<PRE>Chaps,

I'd like to introduce you to Chris and Bastian.


1. Chris Nelson

Chris Nelson is the project lead for Trails, a Java/Tapestry web application
framework inspired by both Naked Objects and Ruby on Rails.  I noticed
Trails from a posting up on theserverside, so dug around the web and located
Chris' email.

I've been raising with Chris the idea of possibly collaborating or
integrating the projects at some level, and Chris is in agreement that this
might well be worth doing.  The caveat is that we both want to develop our
respective code bases further, but a tie-up at some later stage could well
be worthwhile, allowing a single application to be deployed either via RCP
or via the web.  There are three possible levels of collaboration that I've
identified:

* use a common core programming model (progmodel/standard and
progmodel/extended), or
* use common core programming model + have rcpviewer provide common
development-time tooling, or
* use common core programming model + common tooling + a common
implementation of our respective meta-models and perhaps more.

Do check out Trails' website and Chris's rather cool demo of his software in
action.  It's at <A HREF="http://trails.dev.java.net.">http://trails.dev.java.net.</A>


2. Bastian Bergerhoff

Bastian Bergerhoff got in touch with Rob Matthews of Naked Objects Group,
letting him know about a rather neat plugin he'd developed allowing Naked
Objects runtime to be run within Eclipse.  And Rob forwarded him onto me.

Bastians's plugin already supports some level hot swap coding, so you can
make changes to your POJO and the application updates in real-time.  His
vision is to extend this significantly to be able to emulate what Smalltalk
can do in this area.  He is also interested in working on other
development-time tooling (wizards etc) - very much the same space as the
development/tooling side of rcpviewer.


Both Chris and Bastian are now on the wiki (you can see a screenshot of
Bastian's work up there) and subscribe to this mailing list.  I haven't for
now added Chris and Bastian to Subversion.  Chris after all is busy working
on Trails, and Bastian has told me he's happy just to monitor what we're up
to for now but look towards helping on the development tooling side when the
metamodel matures somewhat.  Chris/Bastian: let me know if/when you'd like
deeper involvement.

----
Chris, Bastian: let me briefly introduce you to the other contributors.

Mike Evans is one of our two RCP experts.  I contacted Mike after seeing his
work in an RCP presentation, and asked him if he'd be interested in helping
out.  Mike hadn't heard of NO but liked the idea - I was obviously
persuasive enough since here he is!

Ted Stockwell is the other of our two RCP experts.  This time, Ted contacted
me after rather fortuitously doing some googling and discovering my wiki.
(If he'd googled three days earlier he would have found nothing).

Eoin Woods is one of the best software guys I know, having worked with him
at Sybase.  Although he's now a consultant like me, he has also done plenty
of system engineering; for example he was project lead for implementing
Sybase's clustering on NT server.  He'll tell you (a) how hairy and (b) how
many lines of code that was.  Eoin hasn't been able to contribute yet
because he's been finishing up his book on Software Architecture (just
published last week), but says he's looking forward to working on
persistence/distribution and AOP.

Oh, and there's me.  I think I can justifiably say I have the deepest
knowledge of Naked Objects having been working on it for the last few years
and intensively the last 12 months.  I'm also ok at coding.  So, I'm the
chap with the vision who's hoping he can keep you guys on board to help me
pull it off...

++++
One last thing: there's a risk of having too large a team too early - it's a
risk I'm well aware of.  I'm hoping that as we start to get some
contributions in then the project will divide up into reasonably well
defined areas and everyone can contribute in the area that's most of
interest to them.  Until then, though, here's how I see it:
* Mike and Ted are the RCP runtime experts
* Eoin is the runtime architecture expert
* I'm most interested in owning the metamodel + the development-time
tooling.
* Should Bastian join us, I'd like him to work with me on the tooling.
* And if Chris and I decide to align Trails and RcpViewer, then my ownership
of the metamodel should help see that through.

But let me know if I'm saying things you're unhappy with - as I say I want
to keep everyone on board to make this happen.

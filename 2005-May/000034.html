<PRE>Hi Ted,
glad to see you've been busy :-)

Couple of things to note, though - so here's my long email in return...

1. Metadata

You were talking about getName(), getToolTipText(), getImageDescriptor() and
saying (a) how they aren't in emf-builder, (b) that they shouldn't be, and
(c) you've put the info into plugin.xml.

In fact, the first two are supported - every IDomainClass, attribute,
operation and operation parameter has a name.  And the tooltiptext equates
to the description.  It's a responsibility of the UI components to interpret
the description as tooltiptext.  In the programming model, this information
is provided using @Named and @DescribedAs annotations.

The last one is also supported through the metamodel, but as an extension
object pattern (I've called it Adapter).  I've only just uploaded this, so
it wasn't there when you looked at the code, but it was my plan.

So how it works is thus: one registers an IMetaModelExtension (either
programmatically or more likely we define an extension point in
plugins.xml) - when a POJO is being analyzed and its IDomainClass is being
built, any extensions are asked to contribute their own semantics.  These
are then subsequently available using:

SomeExtension myExtension =
(SomeExtension)someDomainClass.getAdapter(SomeExtension.class);

Have a look at
tests/de.berlios.rcpviewer.progmodel.standard/TestExplicitNamesAndDescriptio
ns#testDomainClassThatIsExplicitlyNamed to see this in action.  The concrete
extension that's tested there is an RcpViewerExtension that is able to
furnish your aforesaid ImageDescriptors.  (You'll note that I use the URL
form of constructing this ImageDescriptor, and the IMetaModelExtension uses
an @ImageUrlAt to save away this URL as an EAnnotation within EMF.  However,
an alternative implementation of this extension - and one that would be
preferable I think - would be to use the Class, fileName:String form.  In
this case no annotation would need to be saved, because the first info is
known, and the second info could be searched for.  I've described this more
in the javadoc for @ImageUrlAt).

You chose to put this extra metadata in plugins.xml whereas I've used the
POJO itself.  You said: &quot;Actually, that's one aspect of NO that I don't care
for, I don't think that an object model should have to be polluted with this
information&quot;, so your preference is outside the POJO model.  I take the
opposite view.  I want rcpviewer to be non technical so that most &quot;domain
programmers&quot; (guys using rcpviewer to write business applications) have a
minimum of things to wrap their heads around.  Now we can expect that they
understand Java and in the next 12 months using annotations will become
commonplace (eg the EJB3 spec).  But understanding the vagaries of
plugin.xml is not something I want these guys - our principle users - to
have to understand.  Also, imagine oneself in this role: in a workshop with
end-users and identifying a POJO and its attributes and operations.  I want
to be able to get this information down as quickly as possible, and the
quickest way is in a single (Java) editor.  Even if we had some rinky dink
wizard to populate this info into plugin.xml, you'd still have to find that
wizard, and run it, and then remember the name of the attribute you are
describing etc - by which time you're out of the flow.  Please remember: I'm
talking about this &quot;domain programmer&quot; role from the point of view of
actually having done it for the last 12 months in Ireland.

All that said, the design I've described doesn't preclude using plugin.xml.
The IMetaModelExtension actually can get its information from anywhere -
even from a database I guess, for example if it were providing help
information.  Another example: one of the things I'd like to build is to use
VEP to create an editor that would allow the application developer to
explicitly specify where fields go on an form - see
<A HREF="http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/tooling/domain-object-ui">http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/tooling/domain-object-ui</A>
-representation/explicit-form-editor for a little more explanation.  Now the
result of this editor might well be a bunch of XML that goes into plugin.xml
(or it could be a new class like a BeanInfo).  But here I'm quite happy that
this information is separate from the POJO, because developing such a
customized representation would typically be done after the main domain
programming, and might even be done by a specialist developer who
concentrates on building UIs.

I hope some of this makes sense - I have a very clear idea about how certain
aspects of rcpviewer are to work - and this happens to be one of them.


2. EMF

Sounds like you've been up to some clever stuff with EMF.  Although I'm
using EMF also to hold the data within emf-builder, I'm not using its
EMF.Edit or code generation features.  And here again I'm a little wary
about it, because it may raise the bar in terms of sophistication of domain
programmers.  Remember that EMF is really an implementation of MOF - a
meta-meta-meta-model.  Most domain programmers I envisage using rcpviewer
would get freaked out at one &quot;meta&quot;.

But I don't want to sound too negative.  If we can use EMF's code gen stuff
to develop either some of our custom viewers for the runtime rcpviewer, or
indeed to provide tooling editors for development time, then fair enough.
Best thing would be to get your stuff uploaded into SVN, then we can review.

Right - it's a Saturday.  Enough already.

Subject: [Rcpviewer-contributors] Starting to need some metadata


Hi All,

Those of you that love really long e-mails are gonna love this one ;-)....

I'm at the point where I'm ready to write code that will open an EMF
object in an Editor, specifically an RCPViewerEditor.
An Eclipse editor must be supplied with an instance of IEditorInput when
the editor is opened.
Among other things IEditorInput must implement these three methods...

    /**
     * Returns the image descriptor for this input.
     */
    public ImageDescriptor getImageDescriptor();

    /**
     * Returns the name of this editor input for display purposes.
     */
    public String getName();

    /**
     * Returns the tool tip text for this editor input.
     */
    public String getToolTipText();


These three items are 'extra' properties, for the UI only, and are not
normally part of a domain object model.
NO requires methods to be added to the domain model to supply this
information.  Actually, that's one aspect of NO that I don't care for, I
don't think that an object model should have to be polluted with this
information.  I'm not sure how the POJO version of NO gets this information.
I've taken a look at the classes in the EMF-Builder project and I didn't
see anything that would get me this information.

So, here is my proposal... I have introduced a new interface,
IRcpViewerMetadata that provides the viewer with access to this information.
As is my usual modis operandi,  I use the Eclipse AdapterManager to get
an IRcpViewerMetadata from any object.  So, when I need an object's
metadata I do this...

    IRcpViewerMetadata metadata= (IRcpViewerMetadata)

Platform.getAdapterManager().getAdapter(IRcpViewerMetadata.class,
anyEObject);

------------------------------

So, instead of modifying the domain model and adding classes that
specify this information I have chosen to put this information into an
XML file and register this file in an extension point,
de.berlios.rcpviewer.metadata.
The metadata extension element points to a file with the XML metadata in it.
So, in the plugin that defines the PurchaseOrder class I have this
extension element in the plugin.xml...

&lt;extension point=&quot;de.berlios.rcpviewer.metadata&quot;&gt;
    &lt;metadata class=&quot;com.example.ppo.PurchaseOrder&quot;
xml=&quot;PurchaseOrder.rvm&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;

Then, when the de.berlios.rcpviewer starts up it rips through all the
de.berlios.rcpviewer.metadata extensions and, for every metadata
element  in an extension, registers an adapter factory that can supply
an instance of IRcpViewerMetadata given an object that implements the
interface named in the metadata's 'class' element.  The
de.berlios.rcpviewer reads the denoted XML file to get the metadata.

Make sense so far?

------------------------------

Here is the best part...

I have modeled the IRcpViewerMetadata in EMF.  Right out of the box I
have an editor for creating/editing metadata.  The default EMF.Edit
editor lets me save the metadata as XML (Ecore  XML).  The EMF framework
gives me tools to load the XML as a IRcpViewerMetadata object.

Since IRcpViewerMetadata is an Ecore object then when the RCPViewer is
completed it will be possible to edit RCPViewer metadata information
using the RCPViewer itself.

But wait!  There's more!
Have you seen the default EMF model editor?  EMF has a default model
editor for creating and editing Ecore models.  This is possible because
ECore itself is expressed as a model that the EMF.Edit framework can use
to generate an editor.
So....the EMF.Edit framework can be used to a) create models (that is,
model the application), and then b) used in the application itself to
create/edit objects.

Following the same pattern as EMF.Edit, if we model the RCPViewer
metadata as ECore objects then the RCPViewer will be able to a) model an
application, and then b) run the application.
It would even be possible to open an application's metadata from within
the application, change the metadata, and then restart to apply the changes!
Cool or what!

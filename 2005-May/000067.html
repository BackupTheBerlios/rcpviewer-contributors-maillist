<PRE>Mike,Ted:
Thanks for your recent contribs into your respective workspaces - I think
that this spikes area works quite well.


Ted:
I had a peruse over your projects, but found some plugin dependencies seemed
to be missing.  Which version of EMF are you using (I'm using 2.0.1 which is
probably a little old?)

Could you also put together a wiki page or README, either online or as a
.wiki - I'm finding it a little difficult to figure out how it all pieces
together.

Finally, I noticed that your acegisecurity library plugin has the wrong
directory + project name - I guess you cloned it from org.apache.log4j.


Both:
I've been tidying up SVN/workspace.  There's a bunch of projects in there
dating back to when we just started.  What I've done is moved them to the
workspace of whoever originally contributed them:
- Build Tools to mikes-workspace
- ECSPlugin to mikes-workspace
- RCPViewer to mikes-workspace
- de.berlios.rcpviewer.nakedobjects to teds-workspace
- org.apache.log4j: have left alone.
I think I have that right.  If this stuff is now junk, then go ahead and
delete from your spike workspace (we can always get it back if nec. :-).  If
it should go somewhere else, let me know.


Finally:
I've renamed emf-builder to de.berlios.rcpviewer.core, and have converted it
into a library plugin.  NB: to get it to export, you need to run Eclipse
itself on a Java 1.5 VM (there was a bug on bugzilla relating to this),
along with 1.5 compliance level in your workspace.

Thanks all,
Dan

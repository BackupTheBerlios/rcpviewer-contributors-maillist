</I>I have developed a Spring plugin for my spike.  I have discovered that 
Spring will make it easier to customize RPCSoftware's system for our 
many clients.
However, Spring cannot be used as a replacement for Eclipse extension 
points since Spring and extension points serve different purposes.
I would characterize the difference as a 'push' model (Spring) versus a 
'pull' model (extension points). 
The difference between the two approaches is that extension points are a 
way of 'pulling' dependencies into an object that are only known at 
runtime whereas Spring can only 'push' those dependencies that are known 
at development time.
Thus extension points are more appropriate for 'extending' very dynamic 
plugin-based products.

On the flip side, extension points can only 'pull' dependencies and 
therefore cannot really be used to replace the implementation of some 
dependency with a different  implementation, the pull model can only 
supply ALL the implementations available, the receiving object would 
have to have some way to distinquish which implementation to use..
Thus Spring is more appropriate for 'configuring' an application by 
assembling components into an application.

In terms of the RCPViewer.  Instead of having an application explicitly 
register all the domain classes with a domain registry when the 
application starts,  the 'Eclipse way' would be to register the domain 
classes via extension points.
In this way the total set of domain classes does not have to be known 
until runtime. 
This aspect of extension points can make team development easier because 
one developer can work on the 'project management' domain while another 
developer works separately on the 'inventory management' domain.  These 
domains can then be included or excluded from the final product merely 
by including or excluding the plugins that contain the domain 
implementation. 


----------------------------------------------

On another note, I'd like to show you all how I wrote the main 
application class for my spike.
This class shows off how I think that Spring will make our system easier 
to customize for our many clients.

When writing my splike I was imagining that I am writing a new version 
or our ERP system (maybe not such a good thing if what you want is a 
simple to understand example, but good if you want an example that will 
make sure that the API is truly reusable).
The main entry point must do two things, authenticate the user and start 
the workbench.
Currently I end up rewriting this class more several clients because I 
need to special stuff when starting the application, or I need to 
authenticate users in various ways.
In the past I have considered using the JAAS API to make it possible to 
integerate different authentication implementations for different 
clients.  Or I could have written our application to the Acegi API to 
accomplish the same thing.
With Spring I was able to abstract out the details of authentication 
while introducing NO DEPENDENCIES AT ALL.  Not even to Spring!

Here is the main runnable for my example...

++++++++

import net.sf.plugins.springframework.SpringApplicationLauncher;

import org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPlatformRunnable;
import org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform;
import org.eclipse.ui.PlatformUI;

import com.example.ppo.commands.AuthenticationCommand;
import com.example.ppo.commands.CreateAndRunWorkbenchCommand;

public class PpoApplication
extends SpringApplicationLauncher
implements IPlatformRunnable
{
    private AuthenticationCommand _authenticationCommand;
    private CreateAndRunWorkbenchCommand _createAndRunWorkbenchCommand;
   
    public PpoApplication(
            AuthenticationCommand pAuthenticationCommand,
            CreateAndRunWorkbenchCommand pWorkbenchCommand
    ) {
        _authenticationCommand= pAuthenticationCommand;
        _createAndRunWorkbenchCommand= pWorkbenchCommand;
    }
   
    public Object run(Object args) throws Exception {
       
        try {
            if (_authenticationCommand.run() == null)
                return null; 
           

            int returnCode = _createAndRunWorkbenchCommand.run();
           
            if (returnCode == PlatformUI.RETURN_RESTART)
                return IPlatformRunnable.EXIT_RESTART;
           
            return IPlatformRunnable.EXIT_OK;
        }
        finally {
            Platform.endSplash();
        }
    }


}

++++++++++++++

Now the main code does just what it's suppose to...it authenticates the 
user and starts the workbench.  However it does this with the help of 
two Stratgey objects that are supplied by Spring.
I can configure any customer's application by starting the application 
with a different Spring configuration and I never need to touch this 
code again.
Best of all, it does not tie the application to any third-party API.

-------------------

My spring plugin has an extension point for registering Spring 
configuration files.
My example application plugin includes a Spring configuration file and 
the file is registered as a Spring bean factory like so...

    &lt;extension point=&quot;net.sf.plugins.springframework.beanFactories&quot;&gt;
        &lt;beanFactory id=&quot;net.sf.plugins.rcpviewer.examples.ppo&quot; 
file=&quot;ppo-beanfactory.xml&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;

The Spring plugin also has an application launcher for running 
Spring-based applications.
Launch Spring applications like so...

    eclipse.exe -application net.sf.plugins.springframework.launcher 
-beanFactory net.sf.plugins.rcpviewer.examples.ppo

...where -beanFactory is the id of a registered bean factory.
The launcher expects to find a bean named &quot;main&quot; that implements 
org.eclipse.runtime.IPlatformRunnable in the denoted bean factory.

-------------------


I have comitted the spring plugin under spikes/teds-workspace (well, I'm 
trying anyway...)

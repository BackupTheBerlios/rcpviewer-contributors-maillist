Before reading this post I responded to one Mike's posts by saying that
almost all GUI-related data should be in the GUI metadata layer.  Now
I'm gonna say that almost all GUI-related data should be in the domain
model.  And I'm correct both times!

The difference is that from now on I will think of the GUI metadata
layer as a 'virtual domain model' built on top of a legacy domain
model.  If a domain model already provides all the methods and
attributes required to work with RCPViewer then very little or no extra
GUI metadata will be required.  A legacy domain model will require more
GUI metadata to be provided.

Does this approach make sense to you guys?


&gt;&gt;<i> Music to my ears!  This is part of what I was getting on the wiki page:
</I>&quot;<A HREF="http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/concepts/virtual-domain">http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/concepts/virtual-domain</A>
-objects&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> Actually, I don't think that the GUI metadata and this virtual domain
</I>model are quite the same.  Really, the virtual domain model is really just
the domain model if it was done correctly.  Now while that means that is
going to be a lot more information in it than your usual legacy model, there
will still be some aspects - such as field ordering or ImageDescriptors -
which can never be properly considered part of the domain model.

&gt;&gt;<i> At any rate, in emf-builder progmodel/standard corresponds to the
</I>representing a domain model; progmodel/extended and progmodel/rcpviewer
correspond to additional GUI metadata.  And I've been coding it so that the
latter two only provide their data through adapters.  (This is in line with
your other posting that the core domain model more-or-less is only what EMF
gives us out of the box).

&gt;&gt;<i> But I think I'm just quibbling here - the important point is that we
</I>(seem to) agree that a decent domain model has a lot more information in it
than one might normal assume.

---
Back in 2003, Richard, Rob and I - along with an academic called Rick
Mugridge (who has been pointing his postgrads at NO for a while now) -
workshopped the different layers that make up an NO application.  Rewriting
that in our current terminology we came up with:

* core domain object
* virtual domain object (aggregated or otherwise synthesised from the
underlying possibly anaemic domain objects)
* state management -  changing whether stuff can been viewed / interacted
with according to its state
* security authorisation - a filtering of attributes and actions with
respect to a particular individual's roles

There's different ways to solve the state management layer.  The NO
framework has a way in which the domain programmer can say things like:
field.unusableInStates({PENDING, IN_QA});
action.usableOnlyInState(AUTHORISED);
Again, I think that we can represent this in our programming model with
annotations.

And the perspective layer can be done entirely outside of the domain layer.

Something else for you guys to mull over (it's a bit off topic, but it's
worth thinking through).  I've made the observation before now that Naked
Objects gives us &quot;subtractive&quot; programming.  That is, a field or an action
will appear unless you have a constraint (either programmatic in the domain
layer, or state-related, or role-related) to say that it shouldn't.  Compare
this to the usual &quot;additive&quot; programming, whereby a field or action only
appears if you explicitly program it in.  Also compare the subtractive
approach to UML whereby a domain model is assumed to have all degrees of
freedom until one starts to constrain it using OCL.  All this stuff again
works to keep the domain model &quot;honest&quot;.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>as a GUI concern.  Q: what sort of things would get grouped?  A: things

&gt;<i>go together.  For example, the UI for a Customer object might have a &quot;Name&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>group might consist of (title/firstname/lastname/suffix).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>But here's the point: apply Eric Evans' Ubiquitous Language principle.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If there's such a thing as a &quot;Name&quot;, then it should be in the domain model.
</I>&gt;<i>So we should say that the Customer class has an immutable composition

</I>&gt;<i>information is all that the UI component needs.  We can then have a

</I>&gt;<i>Name's toString (&quot;Mr. John Daniels&quot;) and when opened up shows the
</I>&gt;<i>constituent fields and allows them to be edited.  The same use of
</I>&gt;<i>relationships for a 1:M relationship should allow Order/Order-Details to be
</I>&gt;<i>shown on a single form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>These are some of the lessons we've learnt from the Irish DSFA gig.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Because the NO framework's viewer isn't really all that sophisticated,
</I>we've
&gt;<i>had to work harder at finding a way to express the information within the
</I>&gt;<i>domain model.  The Name class I quoted is one that from the DSFA.  Another
</I>&gt;<i>example is DateOfBirth (the date, a date verified flag, and a date
</I>&gt;<i>verification source lookup).  Finding ways to represent this info within
</I>the
&gt;<i>domain object means that one can also start to put &quot;know-how-to&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>responsibilities into these objects (eg Name#change, or
</I>&gt;<i>DateOfBirth#verifyUsingSource).  It also - I would argue - makes the domain
</I>&gt;<i>model better than it otherwise would have been: UI grouping really is the
</I>&gt;<i>sign that analysis has been mislocated at the UI layer rather than the
</I>&gt;<i>domain layer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>---
</I>&gt;<i>Of course all of these are variations on the same processing, I am just
</I>&gt;<i>talking about where responsibility lies.  My problem is that I see the
</I>&gt;<i>repsonsibility ending up in several places - a generally bad outcome.
</I>&gt;<i>On the one hand some data is core to the domain model so should be there
</I>&gt;<i>- the name of the field presented to the user for one.  However other
</I>&gt;<i>stuff makes more sense in the GUI configuration - is a date field
</I>&gt;<i>represented by a text box with validation or a calender widget?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I would say that every date field should be rendered the same way.  If
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>there's a reason why a date in one class should be rendered one way, and a
</I>&gt;<i>date in another class should be rendered another, then there is probably
</I>&gt;<i>some difference in domain semantics.  Find a way to capture that
</I>information
&gt;<i>in the domain model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>To make this concrete, suppose a regular Date is rendered as a text box
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>and we choose this as our default rendering.  However, an Appointment's
</I>date
&gt;<i>(which the users conceptually think as occuring on a Calendar) should be
</I>&gt;<i>rendered using a drop-down calendar widget.  In this case, I would suggest
</I>&gt;<i>creating a value object subclass of Date called something like
</I>CalendarDate,
&gt;<i>and have my Appointment use this.  (This is probably so common that
</I>&gt;<i>rcpviewer should ship a library of these values with defined semantics for
</I>&gt;<i>domain programmers to choose from).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>As ever, hope some of the above makes sense....
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My initial response to Dan's comments was gonna be that requiring all
this stuff to be in the domain model was a problem because it excluded
the use of legacy domains that were not 'properly' designed.
For instance, one of my grand visions is to use RCPViewer to create a UI
for UBL (Universal Business Language,
<A HREF="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ubl/charter.php">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ubl/charter.php</A>).  However, since
UBL was not developed with NO sensibilities in mind, it might not be
suitable for use with an NO GUI.

So, my next thought was that I could create a customized domain model on
top of UBL that would group attributes that needed grouping, provide
field orders, create data type subclasses where needed, add methods, etc.
I buy into Dan's argument in favor of the 'Ubiquitous Language
principle' so creating a new domain model on top of any existing legacy
domain model might not be a bad idea because the resulting domain model
could be easier for developers to understand and reuse.

Then it occurred to me that there is really no difference between...

 a) creating a new domain model on top of a legacy domain model and
putting everything that the RCPViewer needs to construct a GUI into the
domain model, and

b) creating GUI metadata model putting everything that the RCPViewer
needs to construct a GUI for a legacy domain model into the GUI metamodel

 From my perspective, options a) and b) are the same.  If I think of the
GUI metamodel as just creating a new domain model on top of a legacy
model and appropriately regrouping, sorting, and changing the data types
of attributes, etc. then suddenly the two approaches appear to be the same.

The only thing that I can think of that absolutely needs to be external
from the domain model into some XML-y type of configuration are labels.

---------------------------------

Before reading this post I responded to one Mike's posts by saying that
almost all GUI-related data should be in the GUI metadata layer.  Now
I'm gonna say that almost all GUI-related data should be in the domain
model.  And I'm correct both times!
The difference is that from now on I will think of the GUI metadata
layer as a 'virtual domain model' built on top of a legacy domain
model.  If a domain model already provides all the methods and
attributes required to work with RCPViewer then very little or no extra
GUI metadata will be required.  A legacy domain model will require more
GUI metadata to be provided.



Does this approach make sense to you guys?

<PRE>Just spend a couple of hours implementing field ordering using annotations
(see Mike's option (a) below).

Up in SVN, or you can see the test case here:
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/rcpviewer/trunk/workspace/emf-builder/test/de/">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/rcpviewer/trunk/workspace/emf-builder/test/de/</A>
berlios/rcpviewer/progmodel/extended/TestPositionedAt.java?view=markup.

I think it's elegant - but then, I wrote it...  thoughts please!

Dan

Subject: Re: [Rcpviewer-contributors] Ted's screenshot - comment posted.


Let's crawl before we can walk, let alone run.
Ted's screenshot is a very desirable interim target.
In fact my thoughts were that such a GUI would be the default based on
annotations without any decorations added.  Methinks Dan is after much
richer base GUI semantics than either Ted or I had in mind.

To be a little more concrete let's take for a simple example, ordering
String fields in an editor.  Let's assume the metamodel provide the GUI
with an 2D array of field names and values (I know, I know - it will be
cleverer than that, but this is illustrative).

So options that occur to me are:
a) the sort order is built into the metamodel which sort the array from
annotation values on the domain POJO's.
b) GUI checks for an ISortAdapter which if found first re-sorts the
array as per its ( xml-based..?) configuration
c) the GUI is user-configurable presenting the user with a default list
and then allowing items to be moved up and down - it then remembers this
order for all future instances (this is sort of like the old Lotus Notes
interface)
d) the GUI applies it own hard-coded rules

Lets look at grouping (either literally with an SWT Group or in an
Expandable Composite), options are:
a) grouping is built into the domain model and it represents this by say
passing a third array column with the name of the group to put the
string into
b) the GUI looks for an xml-based IGroupAdapter which return the fields
in smaller, named arrays, one for each group
c) The GUI is user-configurable as before
d) The GUI starts being clever - if the domain model presents Strings it
just display them; if it presents a struct or javabean, it automatically
groups them.

Of course all of these are variations on the same processing, I am just
talking about where responsibility lies.  My problem is that I see the
repsonsibility ending up in several places - a generally bad outcome.
On the one hand some data is core to the domain model so should be there
- the name of the field presented to the user for one.  However other
stuff makes more sense in the GUI configuration - is a date field
represented by a text box with validation or a calender widget?

PS : I am in full agreement with Dan regarding the Ted's 'Actions' tab -
excellent idea.

</I>&gt;<i> I think there's some excellent ideas here - and some things that I like

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the Navigator view looks very nice.  Nice and clean.  Perhaps
</I>&quot;List&quot;
&gt;<i> should be &quot;Search&quot; - in practical terms one wouldn't want to have a list
</I>of
&gt;<i> every Customer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not nearly so sure about the main view.  While I think that it would be
</I>fine
&gt;<i> to have individual views that hold either then left hand side tree or the
</I>&gt;<i> right-hand side properties, it doesn't (I'm afraid) cut it to me as having
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere near the level of sophistication for typical end-users.  I did
</I>some
&gt;<i> street testing on the wife and in-laws - they agree I'm afraid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I am aiming for is something with the sophistication of Mike's RCP
</I>app
&gt;<i> (eg <A HREF="http://www.incremental.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/screenshots/marketing.png">http://www.incremental.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/screenshots/marketing.png</A>)

</I>or
&gt;<i> Xinity (<A HREF="http://www.xinity.org/?About/Xinity%20BASE">http://www.xinity.org/?About/Xinity%20BASE</A>).  Ultimately I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> UIs with the sophistication of MS Outlook or equivalent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm sorry that the above sounds a little negative.  But let me finish
</I>on
&gt;<i> a high note, which is the Actions tab.  I've been wondering where an
</I>&gt;<i> object's actions might live, but I think that the Actions tab is just
</I>&gt;<i> wonderful.  It also reminds me of the left-hand side bar in Windows'
</I>&gt;<i> Explorer, eg the Search bar or the Write CD bar.  One could have the
</I>&gt;<i> parameters for each such action be exposed  as one clicks on the action.
</I>&gt;<i> This also has the benefit that the actions are not modal, a definite plus
</I>&gt;<i> point.  So thanks - I'm really pleased with that idea.

</I>&gt;<i> Mike/Eoin - any thoughts?

<PRE>Are now in the 'spikes' directory in SVN.
They are not what I set out to do (!).
Curiously they changed from technical spikes into elementary tutorials 
in test-driven plug-in development .  Dunno why - s'pose coz I needed to 
know how to do it myself.
I persevered on the off-chance that it might be useful to someone coming 
into the project not familiar with PDE.  I do not think there is 
anything there that would be of interest to, e.g. Ted.

To give you an idea of what the two (trivial) projects are about I have 
appended the text of the two explanatory wiki pages at the end of the 
e-mail.  That'll help you decide whether to not to take a look at the 
projects.

Spike3 will be a 'proper' spike - using emf-builder's model and looking 
at how a GUI can be built-up from domain relationships and 
multiplicities alone - Composite pattern here I come!

This wiki idea is cool!

~~What I've done~~
1. Created 'mikespike1-runtime' project.  This represents the RCPViewer 
application as used by an end-user.  I did this using the new plug-in 
project wizard, selecting to create an RCP app (second page of wizard) 
and then selecting the 'RCP application with a view' template.
1. Created 'mikespike1-test' project.   This is all the regression tests 
for the 'runtime' component.  For this we still need a plugin project 
(for the PDE test environment) but I chose not to add any code 
(including no plugin class).  I made it dependent on the 
mikespike1-runtime and org.junit plugins ( having configured 
mikespike1-runtime to export the core eclipse plugins it is dependent 
upon).
1. Then created a src package in the test project and wrote a 
junit.framework.TestCase class with a dummy test.
1. Then needed a test run configuration:
1. New 'JUnit Plug-in Test'
1. Name : Test
1. Run all tests in selected package ... : mikespike1_test
1. (next tab) Program to Run : run an application : 
mikespike1_runtime.mikespike1
1. (next tab) Choose plug-ins and frgements to launch : Deselect all 
then select the two 2 mikespike1 plugins;
1. Add Required Plug-ins
1. Run!
1. Added some more tests based on the rcp template's generated code

~~Discussion~~
If you look at the tests you'll see I use reflection to access the 
underlying SWT GUI widgets.  Hence the tests are tied to the underlying 
implementations.  I feel this is OK as:
* to my mind the only way to really test GUI's;
* the Eclipse platform (or at least JFace) forces us down standard 
patterns of implementation anyway so this should not be too much of a 
constraint (as long as we do not keep changing the field names)
* as we are doing Test-Driven development the tests control the code 
anyway...

~~Next Steps~~
So far I have put the cart before the horse in that I added tests to a 
pre-existing implementation - that produced by the RCP wizard.  So spike 
2 will do things properly.  Next goto mikespike2-test/wiki/Index.wiki




***  mikespike2-test/wiki/Index.wiki ***


1 Mike's Spike 2

~~ Introduction ~~
This spike is about developing a basic RcpViewer GUI prototype using 
test-driven development.  Hence this wiki is in the 'test' project 
rather than the 'runtime' project as from now on test precede and 
control development.

This 'test' project itself started out as a cut'n'pasted version of 
mikespike1-test, whilst mikespike2-runtime was created via the new 
project plug-in wizard, selecting an RCP application and choosing the 
Hello World template (I fiddled with some of the names/ids).

Creating a runtime configuration for the mikespike2-runtime plugins only 
(and its required plugins) will show that the wizard has done its work 
and runs up an empty RCP app window.

__Note__ : in addtion configure mikespike2-runtime to export the core 
eclipse plugins it is dependent upon.

~~ Development ~~
Is all controlled from the Test class now.  Each iteration creates a 
test, runs it, fails and then add the implementation to make the test 
pass.  Good ol' XP.  So all other notes and explanations of reside in 
the javadoc of each test.  I realise you are presented with the end 
implementation of all tests but I hope by following each subsequent 
test's javadoc you'll get a handle on my thought processes.

__Note__ : you'll nedd to create a JUnit Plugin Test configuartion using 
only the two mikespike2 plugins and their requisite plugins.

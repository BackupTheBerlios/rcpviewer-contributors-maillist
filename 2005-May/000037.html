<PRE>Mike,
&gt;&gt;<i> thanks for your comments, some additional notes within...
</I>Dan

1. Metadata

Hey - I'm getting involved in the Metadata debate!

I'm actually with Dan here in terms of putting all domain-requisite data
  within the POJO. And annotations is the seemly solution for this.

Additional, shall I say 'decorating', semantics could then be made
available via extension points or any other mechanism.

&gt;&gt;<i> I think &quot;decorating&quot; is actually an excellent term.  This is really what
</I>my IMetaModelExtensions are.  I was also mulling over whether the first
initial analysis (in DomainClass' identifyOperations / identifyAttributes
etc) should also be implemented as a decorator - a bit of &quot;eating our own
dog food&quot;.  This then would allow a different implementation that would
build a metamodel using Java AST/JDOM for development-time tooling, and yet
another implementation that takes the original NO framework's metamodel and
effectively just copies it across.

&gt;&gt;<i> Going back to this term &quot;decorator&quot;... in fact, I've been in touch with
</I>Chris Nelson whose the guy building the Trails webapp framework (I'll let
you look it up on google).  It was his solution to use a decorator for
building his metamodel, so I'm just adapting his idea.

---
POJO annotations alone must provide a fully functional, if basic, GUI.

&gt;&gt;<i> In fact I think it should be possible to build a basic GUI without any
</I>annotations.  After all, that's what the NO framework does.  POJO
annotations should be able to add rather more sophistication - though there
is a potential scalability problem, as Ted has noted elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;<i> Where POJO annotations won't be enough is when one wishes to break the
</I>strict 1:1 correspondence between domain object and its UI representation.
I've discussed this idea a little in
<A HREF="http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/concepts/virtual-domain-">http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/concepts/virtual-domain-</A>
objects.

---
Extensions can then be used to override the default implementation - in
Eclipse using the standard Platform.getAdapterManager().getAdapter( ...)
pattern.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'd rather do this using MetaModel.getDomainClass(...).getAdapter(...)
</I>rather than from Platform.  That's mostly so that it can be reused
independently from Eclipse itself.  That (a) makes it easier to test
(regular JUnit tests rather than PDEUnit tests), and (b) might even allow
the metamodel to be used in other NO-like products (getting ahead of myself
as usual, I admit I've suggested the idea to Chris Nelson, though no reply
thus far...).

---
2. EMF
Sounds like we have a basic 'runtime' RcpViewer and a development 'pro'
version:
Runtime:
  - standalone RCP app
  - packaged with domain model and preconfigured domain data
  - for Dan's 'domain programmers'
Development
  - superset of runtime's plugins but normally runs within Eclipse
  - allows manipulation of Ted's clever self-describing EMF models.
  - runs up the runtime version for testing
  - magic wizards for auto-deployment of runtime.

&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed; a runtime platform and a development platform.  The design page
</I>on the wiki discusses ideas for the former, the tooling page discusses ideas
for the latter (<A HREF="http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/design">http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/design</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/tooling">http://www.haywood-associates.co.uk/rcpviewer/space/tooling</A>).

&gt;&gt;<i> Where you've slightly misunderstood though is that the runtime RCP app is
</I>not for &quot;domain programmers&quot;, it is for end users.  The domain programmers
are developers, so they use the development platform.  But, the basic Java
editor + annotations should be enough for a domain programmer to get a basic
RCP app up and running.  There can then be more specialist developers who
will use other editors that we provide in the development platform to make
the GUI more customised.  The ones on the tooling page describe such editors
that most domain programmers should be able to operate.  But a GUI
programmer might also want to develop a brand new view, eg a Map or an
Outlook-style journal or calendar.  And so these guys would definitely need
to be Eclipse-savvy and we might provide wizards to help them do it.

---
Note with time the boundaries would blur - in fact it might be better to
think of the runtime to be no more than the development version with the
'RCPDevelopment' capability disabled.

&gt;&gt;<i> To an extent.  However, the tooling plugins run within a single VM,
</I>whereas the runtime would be launching another VM.

&gt;&gt;<i> That said, a chap (Bastian Bergerhoff) got in touch from Germany with Rob
</I>Matthews - he has embedded the current NO framework as a plugin to Eclipse.
It's very odd to see as a screenshot!  What he's working on then is hot-swap
deployment, so that one can change the code and the running application
changes in real-time.  Any of you done Smalltalk?  I haven't, but old-timers
are always banging on about how good Smalltalk was because it can support
this idea.
&gt;&gt;<i> So, if he gets this working, then perhaps the two sets of plugins will
</I>merge to some extent.  But I still see the development time platform as
being used by developers, whereas the runtime RCP platform is for use by
users.

---
This would also give us a division of responsibilites - runtime GUI vs
development and builder tools.

&gt;&gt;<i> Absolutely.  The two should have a common extensible metamodel capable of
</I>supporting both sets of requirements.  The runtime metamodel is immutable
and is built by reflection, the development-time metamodel is mutable and is
built by Eclipse's Java AST/Java DOM APIs.

&gt;&gt;<i> It makes sense to me that Mike and Ted initially focus on the runtime RCP
</I>(picking up on your experience there), and I'll focus on the common
meta-model and the development time tooling (picking up on my TogetherJ
experience).  I'm hoping I can get Bastian in on the development-time side
too (when the meta-model is stable) since he's interested in this area and
has written some Eclipse plugins.  And hopefully I'd like Eoin to work on
the back-end for the runtime (distribution, persistence etc) - Eoin? are you
there?!

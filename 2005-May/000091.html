Subject: [Rcpviewer-contributors] Persistence

I expect that each application will handle persistence in its own way.
Some applications may use Hibernate, some may save objects as XML in a
file system, etc.

&gt;&gt;<i> agreed.  NO framework also has an &quot;in-memory&quot; objectstore which is
</I>v. useful for unit testing.  There's a preliminary version of this in
(what these days is called) de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.runtime plugin.


As I see it it, RCPViewer should not have any API to actually *perform*
persistence, RCPViewer merely needs a way to hook up peristence objects
to the GUI.

&gt;&gt;<i> to an extent I agree.  However, I think that the RcpViewer should have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knowledge of a certain regular lifecycle of states that persistable
</I>objects
&gt;&gt;<i> can go through.  For example, an object might be created but not yet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> persisted; or might subsequently be persisted.  I think in any enterprise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> persistence mechanism (JDO, Hibernate and EJB3) these should exist.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Searching is another area where there should be some support.  On the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DSFA project we've used DDD Repositories very successfully.  We
</I>externalized
&gt;&gt;<i> all searches into Repository objects, and then had different
</I>implementations
&gt;&gt;<i> according to the persistence mechanism in use.  So at a very least the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RcpViewer should provide some infrastructure to make the Repository
</I>pattern
&gt;&gt;<i> the easiest thing for domain programmers to use.
</I>

In order to implement this I propose adding a new method to IDomainClass
named isNewable().  isNewable() returns true if the class should be
included on the File | New menu.  The default value is false.

&gt;&gt;<i> That's fine - there's something similar in the NO framework.  Do you have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any suggestions on how we pick up the fact that a given POJO class is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-instantiable?  eg, in the NO framework one would write:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public class Customer {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   public static void aboutCustomer(ClassAbout about) {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    about.uninstantiable();
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (In other words, adding the info in the meta-model is one thing; one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also must decide what the programming model is - ie what the POJOs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be coded up as.
</I>

... Editor support for Save, SaveAs methods ... I propose that
IDomainObjects
that IDomainObject extends the org.eclipse.ui.ISaveablePart interface
NOTE: This ties IDomainObject to an Eclipse API.  Is this a bad thing?

&gt;&gt;<i> I thought when I read this first time that I'd have a problem with this,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I don't think I do.  I can see the IDomain/IDomainClass metamodel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being reused in other contexts, but ISession/IDomainObject are specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Eclipse.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said, an alternative approach would be to have IDomainObject be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adaptable, eg
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   ISaveablePart sp =
</I>(ISaveablePart)someDomainObject.getAdapter(ISaveablePart.class);
&gt;&gt;<i> so that we don't pollute the IDomainObject with Eclipse specifics.
</I>
----------------

Assuming all of the above os OK then the next question is how do I
create an implementation of the RCPViewer API that uses POJOs?

&gt;&gt;<i> Let me stop you there for a second: when I read on it seems that you've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made &quot;newability&quot; and &quot;saveability&quot; interchangeable.  I don't think they
</I>are.
&gt;&gt;<i> For example, at DSFA we have an object which can be created but can never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be saved.  So my answers below reflect this.
</I>

The simple answer would be to require high level POJOs that are
'newable' to implement the org.eclipse.ui.ISaveablePart interface.
However, if we require POJOs to implement a specific interface then
they're not really POJOs anymore are they?

&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed, don't like this.  Saying that an IDomainObject is (or can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide) an ISaveablePart is *not* the same thing as saying that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> POJO that it wraps is an ISaveablePart.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My suggestion would be to use naming conventions for both of these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two concerns of &quot;newability&quot; and &quot;saveability&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the domain programmer provides a &quot;created&quot; method, then we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> say that the object can be - erm - created.  And if the domain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programmer provides a &quot;save()&quot; method, then its saveable.
</I>

My answer is to provider POJO classes that are 'newable' with an Eclipse
adapter factory that can adapt POJO instances that are saveable to
implementations of ISaveablePart.

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think that adapter factories are appropriate for the POJOs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves.  Remember that we only ever interact with the POJOs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through the IDomainObjects which can translate the requirements of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rest of the RcpViewer framework into &quot;things that the POJO understand&quot;.
</I>

----------------
BTW, I would have suggested integrating RCPView with the Eclipse 'New
Wizard' functionality but I have found that the 'New Wizards'
functionality isn't exactly suitable for RCPViewer.  The problem with
Eclipse 'New Wizards' is that they REQUIRE a wizard page to be shown for
whatever object you are creating.

&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps if there is a created(...) method in the POJO which takes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some arguments, then this would be interpreted as providing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wizard to gather those arguments?
</I>


---------------
NOTE: I don't see any need for the IObjectStore interface in the
RCPViewer API.

&gt;&gt;<i> You may well be right, on the other hand it is only a sketch.  It might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be needed to enshrine what RcpViewer requires in terms of persistence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lifecycle state.
</I>
---------------

Anyway, I will create a simple axmple of these ideas from mikespike3 and
hopefully post it in a couple/few days.

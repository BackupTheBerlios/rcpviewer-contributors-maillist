I wouldn't call it &quot;full&quot;, but it's great that we're now moving
onto a stage of dividing out &quot;real&quot; work like this.

So, yes, I'll do the sample metamodel, and I think that I may as well
do PetStore - foreseeing a linecount announcement on TSS in Jan 2006!

A lot of the validation stuff should be driven out of the
metamodel, which is my area too.  So, I'll do some work here to
define an API and interaction model for the GUI components. 

Similarly, I have an approach in mind for authorization which is
related to this (based on how NO framework does it, works pretty well),
so hold off on that side until I can do some stuff in the metamodel 
to show what I have in mind.

I'll post up this list up on the wiki, probably a better place for it to
live (though I suspect you guys have forgotten your password ;-)

</I>Forgot to add security to the list.  That is, handling authentication 
and authorization.
I would like to work on this aspect also.

Also just though of Undo/Redo.  That would be SO cool to have in the 
RCPViewer.

Also, as Mike pointed out in another message, we should make the 
framework testable early on.

So, the full RCPViewer 'TODO' list is now...
...add persistence to mikespike3 (TED).
...expand the default viewer layout capability (MIKE)
...create a sample metamodel for development purposes (DAN?)
...add validation functionality to mikespike3 (UNASSIGNED)
...make framework testable (MIKE)
...add undo/redo support. (UNASSIGNED)
...add authentication/authorization (TED)

</I>

My apologies - the behaviour you have (ops view parameters per instance)
*is* what I wanted.  Don't know what I thought I was seeing when I wrote my
earlier email.

That said, the point you raise still applies because of the a-modal nature
of the design.  Suppose that there are 10 widgets in stock, and Order A.1
for Customer A (not yet saved) is for 5.  The save operation is enabled
because we do have enough widgets for the order (we don't support
backorders).  We then create Order B.1 for Customer B is for 6 widgets, and
we save that immediately.  When we go back to the still-to-be-saved Order
A.1, its save operation should not be disabled because there are only 4
widgets in stock.

I have a solution, though.  You recall I said I wanted to create an
IOperation that you could then register listeners on.  This would be
analogous to the IDomainObject that the editors listen upon.  So one of the
things callbacks would be the usability (invokability) of an operation.  So,
each entry in your ops view would be backed by a corresponding IOperation.

How to accomplish this magic?  Well, first I will have a central registry of
all currently instantiated IOperations, held in a WeakHashMap in some
singleton.  Whenever any operation is performed on any object, we then run
through all IOperations and get them to work out if they can be invoked or
not.  If they determine that they are now in a different state (cannot now
be invoked when previously could, or vice versa), then they will notify
their listeners.

And how to make sure that after any operation is performed (eg save() of
Order B.1) that we do this impact analysis of all instantiated IOperations?
Using aspects, of course (probably an after() pointcut or equivalent).

What I don't like about this design is that we are effectively polling all
pending operations on the off-chance that some of them will have changed
their state.  But other than somehow declaratively specifying the impact of
any given operation, I can't see any better solution/

I suspect that these IOperations might be part of the forthcoming job stuff,
though they are very much in the ...domain plugin (model) rather than the
...gui (view).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... thrown up a couple of things, dead easy to fix I'm sure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. if you instantiate an Order then fails to build the editor:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DateFieldBuilder:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 		public void setGuiValue(Object obj) {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 			if ( !(obj instanceof Date) ) throw new
</I>&gt;<i> IllegalArgumentException();
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 			_text.setText( FORMATTER.format( (Date)obj ) );
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 		}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because obj is null.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Might just need a guard against null?  But I remember you
</I>&gt;<i> saying that null
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handling was on your todo list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ooops - null check indeed required - added and committed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. I'm only registering 4 classes, but all domain classes appear in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; classbar view.  Could you show only the 4 classes in this view?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Err... it being early I may be being dumb but aren't domain classes by
</I>&gt;<i> definition those that are registered?  Have a look at
</I>&gt;<i> DomainRegistryUtil.iterateAllClasses() - I basically get all domains
</I>&gt;<i> from the domain registry and then iteratte through domain.classes() on
</I>&gt;<i> each.  What ought I be doing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By the way, now had a chance to look at the latest version of the action
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; view (could we rename this to operation view to be consistent with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; metamodel?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Operation view&quot; it is.  Another chance for SVN to screw up...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have to say that it works rather better than I thought, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is nice.  I still think a slightly prettier version will be
</I>&gt;<i> needed at some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stage - one that *doesn't* rely on colours - but its more than
</I>&gt;<i> good enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for now.  Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking of decorated icons which indicate:
</I>&gt;<i> - nullability
</I>&gt;<i> - validity
</I>&gt;<i> - anything else you can think of.
</I>&gt;<i> These icons would be used by FieldBuilders too.
</I>&gt;<i> However that's for later.

One of the problems we need to solve is that the prerequisites for accessing
an attribute or reference, or for invoking an operation, could change as the
result of some quite unrelated change made either by the current user on
another domain object in their session or potentially as a result of an
update by some other user.

We don't want to have the UI continually poll the domain model to determine
if such-and-such a field for an attribute or OK button for an operation
should be enabled and disabled.  Instead the domain model should provide a
callback to which the UI can subscribe and be notified whenever the domain
model determines that there has been a change such that the prerequisites
(preconditions) for such-and-such a currently observed feature have now
changed.

So that's what I've been working on, and have committed a first cut that
works for attributes (the operations and references might work too, but I
haven't written the tests).  Whenever the UI asks the domain object for an
(extended) attribute, reference or operation, it is also added as a weak
reference to a collection held by the domain object's session.  Then,
courtesy of AspectJ, whenever a change is made to *any* domain object, we
ask every observed feature to recompute its own prerequisites and if it
determines that there has been a change, to notify its own observers.

At the moment this is a little cruder than I'd like because this process can
happen multiple times.  Ideally it should be performed only once at the end
of the &quot;tranaaction&quot;.  So that stuff will follow as a refinement.

Luvverly!  But Mike's UI code does still need to be changed to exploit this
capability.  All is quiet in Scotland (and everywhere else it seems - sigh).

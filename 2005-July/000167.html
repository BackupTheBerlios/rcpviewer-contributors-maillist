<PRE>Latest, greatest action view impl committed.
Two major changes:

1. Primitives
There are field builders and DnD transfer adapters for all primitive 
types and their wrappers.  No units tests yet as I still consider myself 
to be 'catching up'.
Once the impl's settle down a bit and Dan has enough of a GUI to work on 
I'll go back to test these.

2. Actions View
In response to Dan's mail below I have offered a partial solution whilst 
retaining the tree.  The core idea is the use of an IColorProvider to 
indicate whether a tree item is valid, and dynamic tooltip to offer more 
info.  At the moment the logic is pretty dumb, simply preventing nulls, 
but can easily be extended once Dan's meta model provides more info. 
Really all I am doing is demonstrating possible GUI behaviour.  Issues 
arising:
* is it not bad GUI practice to rely on colous alone?
* I find the tooltip thing really annoying - would it be better to have 
a context-sensitive text field below the main tree?
* currently if an action is not valid (i..e params are null) it will not 
fire - hence making redundant the 'ActionArg's dialog.  However perhaps 
we could still use this to offer more friendly user feedback if the user 
does try to execute an invalid operation..?


Still to do [and when I'll do it]:
* Cell editors for all primitive types (realised I had not done these as 
typing this mail!) [tomorrow]
* ARRAYS - more faff - [leave for the moment and get on with collections]
* DnD type safety is currently too tight - cannot drag a short onto an 
int [the future].

Dan - there are further comments below on your mail.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all the work on the action view.  I know you've still got a bunch
</I>&gt;<i> more boilerplate to do, so before you go do that I wanted to feedback some
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts 'cos I'm not sure the treeview approach will be quite rich enough.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To make this concrete, let's just consider one of operations in the Petstore
</I>&gt;<i> app (though actually I paraphrase cos it isn't implemented quite like this
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment).  One is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public OrderItem addOrderLine(
</I>&gt;<i>       @DescribedAs(&quot;Item to be purchased&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>       Item item,
</I>&gt;<i>       @Named(&quot;Quantity&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>       @DescribedAs(&quot;Number of the item to be purchased; if not specified
</I>&gt;<i> then assume 1&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>       @Optional
</I>&gt;<i>       int quantity)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> which returns an OrderItem (an order line of an Order) for purchasing said
</I>&gt;<i> quantity of said Item.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now there are two prerequisites to this.  The first is declarative in the
</I>&gt;<i> parameter list in that the Item is not @Optional (though the quantity is).
</I>&gt;<i> If this prerequisite is not met then the operation should be disabled.  I
</I>&gt;<i> imagined this being rendered as an OK button being greyed out.  Your earlier
</I>&gt;<i> dialog box had something a little like this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second prerequisite is programmatic to specify says that an order lines
</I>&gt;<i> can only be added provided that the order has not already have shipped.
</I>&gt;<i> This would be coded something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public IPrerequisites addOrderLinePre(Item item, int quantity) {
</I>&gt;<i>   return Prerequisites
</I>&gt;<i>          .require(getOrder().getStatus() == Order.State.NOT_SHIPPED, &quot;Cannot
</I>&gt;<i> have been shipped&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>          .andRequire(quantity &gt;= 0, &quot;Quantity cannot be negative&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this prereq is not satisfied, then again the operation should be
</I>&gt;<i> disabled.  I envisaged that the error message (accessible from the returned
</I>&gt;<i> IPrerequisites) would appear as a tooltip over a disabled OK button.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm thinking that the action view will at least need to have an OK button
</I>&gt;<i> for each operation, even those that take no parameters.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion then is would it be possible to reimplement the action view in
</I>&gt;<i> a style similar to the default editors for the domain objects themselves?  I
</I>&gt;<i> had a vision that each operation would still be listed but then when
</I>&gt;<i> clicking on the operation name would reveal the parameter list (if any)
</I>&gt;<i> along with an OK button that would initially be disabled if prerequisites
</I>&gt;<i> have not been met?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another benefit is that it should make it easier to be able to group related
</I>&gt;<i> operations together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Something else related: I've been mulling over these operations with the
</I>&gt;<i> prerequisites and it seems to me that the metamodel (IDomain et al) should
</I>&gt;<i> work harder on behalf of the UI layer.  In particular, I think that each
</I>&gt;<i> IDomainObject should be able to return an IOperation for each of the (EMF)
</I>&gt;<i> EOperations.  This IOperation should then provide listeners so that the UI
</I>&gt;<i> can be told directly when to enable or disable the OK button, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> continually have to poll the metamodel.  So, if another operation were
</I>&gt;<i> invoked that shipped the Order, then any pending &quot;addOrderLine&quot; operation
</I>&gt;<i> would be notified that it should now be disabled out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Much of a muchness really.  I'll put all metamodel polling into utility 
methods anyway so the code will not be much clearer one way or the 
other.  Go for whatever you think is easiest form a maintainability 
point of view.

&gt;<i> Similarly, I think that the IDomainObject should be able to return an
</I>&gt;<i> IAttribute, because there are prerequisites for the editability of
</I>&gt;<i> attributes also.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just wanted to say all this before you spend ages doing boring boilerplate
</I>&gt;<i> code.  If you agree, it might be worthwhile leaving the action view as it is
</I>&gt;<i> until I've worked on these IOperations etc and turn to something else (eg
</I>&gt;<i> collections).  Alternatively, carry on to get the action view working as a
</I>&gt;<i> first-cut, knowing we'll need to go round the loop to get prerequisites
</I>&gt;<i> functionality working.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I avoided boring boilerplate by super-duper generic parent classes. 
Time will only tell if this was sensible...

&gt;<i> Let me know what you think...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dan

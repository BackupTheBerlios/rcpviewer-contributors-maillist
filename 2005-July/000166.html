<PRE>Hi Mike,

Thanks for all the work on the action view.  I know you've still got a bunch
more boilerplate to do, so before you go do that I wanted to feedback some
thoughts 'cos I'm not sure the treeview approach will be quite rich enough.

To make this concrete, let's just consider one of operations in the Petstore
app (though actually I paraphrase cos it isn't implemented quite like this
at the moment).  One is:

public OrderItem addOrderLine(
      @DescribedAs(&quot;Item to be purchased&quot;)
      Item item,
      @Named(&quot;Quantity&quot;)
      @DescribedAs(&quot;Number of the item to be purchased; if not specified
then assume 1&quot;)
      @Optional
      int quantity)

which returns an OrderItem (an order line of an Order) for purchasing said
quantity of said Item.

Now there are two prerequisites to this.  The first is declarative in the
parameter list in that the Item is not @Optional (though the quantity is).
If this prerequisite is not met then the operation should be disabled.  I
imagined this being rendered as an OK button being greyed out.  Your earlier
dialog box had something a little like this.

The second prerequisite is programmatic to specify says that an order lines
can only be added provided that the order has not already have shipped.
This would be coded something like:

public IPrerequisites addOrderLinePre(Item item, int quantity) {
  return Prerequisites
         .require(getOrder().getStatus() == Order.State.NOT_SHIPPED, &quot;Cannot
have been shipped&quot;)
         .andRequire(quantity &gt;= 0, &quot;Quantity cannot be negative&quot;);
}

If this prereq is not satisfied, then again the operation should be
disabled.  I envisaged that the error message (accessible from the returned
IPrerequisites) would appear as a tooltip over a disabled OK button.

So I'm thinking that the action view will at least need to have an OK button
for each operation, even those that take no parameters.

My suggestion then is would it be possible to reimplement the action view in
a style similar to the default editors for the domain objects themselves?  I
had a vision that each operation would still be listed but then when
clicking on the operation name would reveal the parameter list (if any)
along with an OK button that would initially be disabled if prerequisites
have not been met?

Another benefit is that it should make it easier to be able to group related
operations together.

Something else related: I've been mulling over these operations with the
prerequisites and it seems to me that the metamodel (IDomain et al) should
work harder on behalf of the UI layer.  In particular, I think that each
IDomainObject should be able to return an IOperation for each of the (EMF)
EOperations.  This IOperation should then provide listeners so that the UI
can be told directly when to enable or disable the OK button, rather than
continually have to poll the metamodel.  So, if another operation were
invoked that shipped the Order, then any pending &quot;addOrderLine&quot; operation
would be notified that it should now be disabled out.

Similarly, I think that the IDomainObject should be able to return an
IAttribute, because there are prerequisites for the editability of
attributes also.

Just wanted to say all this before you spend ages doing boring boilerplate
code.  If you agree, it might be worthwhile leaving the action view as it is
until I've worked on these IOperations etc and turn to something else (eg
collections).  Alternatively, carry on to get the action view working as a
first-cut, knowing we'll need to go round the loop to get prerequisites
functionality working.

Let me know what you think...

Dan

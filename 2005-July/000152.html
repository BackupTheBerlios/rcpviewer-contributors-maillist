<PRE>... as promised, just committed (rev 401) an aspect (actually two: an
abstract IPojoAspect and a subaspect NotifyListenersAspect) that detect
changes to pojos (eg as a result of invoking an operation) and then - using
IDomainObject - notify any listeners.  In other words, the
CounterBean#increment() operation actually changes the value of the display
field.

So you'll need to add the AspectJ 1.2.1xxxx as a plugin to your Eclipse
installation.

Two other things to update you on:

1. Checkstyle

I've added a checkstyle builder to a number of the projects.  This is using
an externally configured rcpviewer_checks.xml that lives in a '00 project
control' project in the main workspace.  You'll notice that virtually all of
the checks are commented out, but I've put my vote against each one.  I
invite you to either vote for each one, and I'll do a review.
Alternatively, if there's a check that you feel passionately should be in,
and no-one has voted against it, then try adding it in and see what how much
code is in violation.  I suggest we use this mailing list as a way of
tracking this.  But we should only add in checks one-by-one.

What all that means though is that you should also add checkstyle 4.0.0b
plugin (3.1 compatible) to your Eclipse installation.

2. Petstore

I've started to develop a more realistic project, namely petstore.  As of
now it's basically just the &quot;domain&quot; classes from xpetstore.sourceforge.net
project - though they need some behaviour adding to 'em.  It was nice to see
I only had to add a couple of @TypeOf() annotations to get the metamodel to
build okay.

<PRE>Mike, within..


&gt;<i> DnD:
</I>&gt;<i> We now have DnD for DomainObjects which is 'type-safe' - e.g. you can't
</I>&gt;<i> drop a EasyBean instance on an AnotherEasyBean field.  You can see this
</I>&gt;<i> if you open the action arguments dialog for the Counter.increment(
</I>&gt;<i> EasyBean bean1, AnotherEasyBean bean2) method, and drag instances from
</I>&gt;<i> the session tree onto it.
</I>&gt;<i> The impl smells so I'd ask Ted to have a look; in particular:
</I>
Still, it seems to work ok for me.  Thanks.


&gt;<i> Other Stuff: LabelProvider
</I>&gt;<i> I have added an additional extension point (IDomainObjectLabelProvider)
</I>&gt;<i> to allow users to specialise the display text and icon for instances of
</I>&gt;<i> particular IDomainClass's.  This is used by the DefaultEditor,
</I>&gt;<i> FieldBuilders etc.
</I>
Ooh. - we might be about to have a rare disagreement here.  The UI should be
able to obtain *all* of its information from the IDomainObject and
associated IDomainClass.  So it shouldn't be going to some other repository
(ie the manifest) to pick up this extra information.

For example, a domain object an Order might want to have different icons (or
perhaps different overlays of icons) to represent its state.  Even though
this is rendered on the UI, it is still business logic and so belongs in the
domain object.

Of course, the way in which an icon is described in domain objects (using an
annotation) will introduce a coupling to Eclipse itself.  (Then again,
putting this information into a manifest is also a dependency).  At any
rate, that's why I introduced the idea of IDomainBuilder.  If you
Navigate&gt;Open Type for RcpViewerProgModelBuilder (in ...domain.runtime) then
you can see the code for picking up an @ImageUrlAt annotation.  This later
annotation is defined in the ...progmodel.rcpviewer package.  And you can
see an example usage in ProspectiveSale fixture (...domain.fixture) with
test in TestImageDescriptor (...domain.tests).

So I'm hoping the above is persuasive enough, because I know that Ted
doesn't really agree with me on this sort of use of annotations.  I just
think its an easier binding than putting this info into (what is basically)
a deployment descriptor.



&gt;<i> Field builder and label provider factories are back in the base gui
</I>&gt;<i> package as I take any opportunity I can to decrease scope of objects.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for all this package juggling.
</I>
I have some package juggling to do myself, but I'll leave it till it becomes
too painful.


&gt;<i> AAAARGGHH! Stuff : SVN
</I>&gt;<i> ... which brings me to SVN.
</I>&gt;<i> I have attached a screenshot of the error(s) I get everytime I try to
</I>&gt;<i> sync the ...gui project. Any ideas?
</I>&gt;<i> Hence I had to sync / commit at (almost) file level this time.  I think
</I>&gt;<i> everything is OK.  Let me know if you have any problems.  When i get
</I>&gt;<i> back, I'll export the project afresh from the repository to see if this
</I>&gt;<i> gets rid of my problems.
</I>
That really shouldn't be necessary - but no ideas as to what's going on in
your sync view.

That said, I've now taken to using TSVN for all updates and all commits, and
I just do them on SVN/trunk/workspace.  It's a bit of a sledgehammer, and of
course it isn't as pretty as the Eclipse sync view, but it *is* reliable.
But of course I am using Subclipse implicitly every time I do a refactoring
(move or rename), because it is calling the appropriate SVN APIs.  And
that's worth a lot to me.  I definitely don't want this to be the first OSS
project that moves from SVN to CVS!



&gt;<i> Finally: AspectJ
</I>&gt;<i> Dan - Though I have AspectJ in and the ...acme and ...runtime.domain
</I>&gt;<i> projects dutifully have aspectJ natures, it does not seem to actually
</I>&gt;<i> change anythign when I run.  Something else for me to look at on
</I>&gt;<i> my return.
</I>
Dunno - I've done a complete update (I move the old trunk to one side now
and again after I've committed) and seems okay.

Try opening up the cross references view and see if the dummy
de.berlios.rcpviewer.progmodel.standard.aspects.Customer class (in
...domain.runtime) is annotated with at all.  So far as the gui.acme plugin
is concerned, all I had to do in the end was to expose the classes to the
aspect: Project &gt; Properties &gt; AspectJ Aspect Path &gt; Libraries &gt; Add Class
Folder &gt; de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.runtime/bin.  This info doesn't seem to
get put into the manifest, I guess its in .project?

Last thing: since there was that issue a while back regarding extension
point metadata being cached, I now have my run configuration to always flush
the runtime workspace.  Perhaps that's worth a try?

And last last thing: you could also try enabling the trace aspect to see if
that gives you any joy (either directly against the ...aspects.Customer as
(a) regular project, (b) plugin project, then same again against the
...gui.acme classes).


Dan

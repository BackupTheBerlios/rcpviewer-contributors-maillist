Yuh - it works, but ...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Other Stuff: LabelProvider
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I have added an additional extension point (IDomainObjectLabelProvider)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to allow users to specialise the display text and icon for instances of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>particular IDomainClass's.  This is used by the DefaultEditor,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>FieldBuilders etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ooh. - we might be about to have a rare disagreement here.  The UI should be
</I>&gt;<i> able to obtain *all* of its information from the IDomainObject and
</I>&gt;<i> associated IDomainClass.  So it shouldn't be going to some other repository
</I>&gt;<i> (ie the manifest) to pick up this extra information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, a domain object an Order might want to have different icons (or
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps different overlays of icons) to represent its state.  Even though
</I>&gt;<i> this is rendered on the UI, it is still business logic and so belongs in the
</I>&gt;<i> domain object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, the way in which an icon is described in domain objects (using an
</I>&gt;<i> annotation) will introduce a coupling to Eclipse itself.  (Then again,
</I>&gt;<i> putting this information into a manifest is also a dependency).  At any
</I>&gt;<i> rate, that's why I introduced the idea of IDomainBuilder.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> Navigate&gt;Open Type for RcpViewerProgModelBuilder (in ...domain.runtime) then
</I>&gt;<i> you can see the code for picking up an @ImageUrlAt annotation.  This later
</I>&gt;<i> annotation is defined in the ...progmodel.rcpviewer package.  And you can
</I>&gt;<i> see an example usage in ProspectiveSale fixture (...domain.fixture) with
</I>&gt;<i> test in TestImageDescriptor (...domain.tests).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm hoping the above is persuasive enough, because I know that Ted
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't really agree with me on this sort of use of annotations.  I just
</I>&gt;<i> think its an easier binding than putting this info into (what is basically)
</I>&gt;<i> a deployment descriptor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yup - I expected comments on these lines.  Having spectated at your 
discussions with Ted, I am trying to keep both camps happy.

As per FieldBuilders, standard behavior is to look for a specialist 
extension and if none found, use a default LabelProvider.  I intend to 
build all the annotation-based logic into this default implementation, 
obviously in some sort of fail-safe way if the annotations aren't 
present.  This I could call DansDefaultLabelProvider.
Ted can then choose to override this behaviour with his own 
IDomainObjectLabelProvider extension which can be configured any way he 
wishes.
Then we can release both and see which the user community favours.
This is clearly favouritism to Dan as his will be the default and Ted's 
the extension, so next time there's a disagreemet I'll side with Ted.



&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Field builder and label provider factories are back in the base gui
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>package as I take any opportunity I can to decrease scope of objects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Sorry for all this package juggling.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have some package juggling to do myself, but I'll leave it till it becomes
</I>&gt;<i> too painful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>AAAARGGHH! Stuff : SVN
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>... which brings me to SVN.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I have attached a screenshot of the error(s) I get everytime I try to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>sync the ...gui project. Any ideas?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hence I had to sync / commit at (almost) file level this time.  I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>everything is OK.  Let me know if you have any problems.  When i get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>back, I'll export the project afresh from the repository to see if this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>gets rid of my problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That really shouldn't be necessary - but no ideas as to what's going on in
</I>&gt;<i> your sync view.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I've now taken to using TSVN for all updates and all commits, and
</I>&gt;<i> I just do them on SVN/trunk/workspace.  It's a bit of a sledgehammer, and of
</I>&gt;<i> course it isn't as pretty as the Eclipse sync view, but it *is* reliable.
</I>&gt;<i> But of course I am using Subclipse implicitly every time I do a refactoring
</I>&gt;<i> (move or rename), because it is calling the appropriate SVN APIs.  And
</I>&gt;<i> that's worth a lot to me.  I definitely don't want this to be the first OSS
</I>&gt;<i> project that moves from SVN to CVS!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Finally: AspectJ
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Dan - Though I have AspectJ in and the ...acme and ...runtime.domain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>projects dutifully have aspectJ natures, it does not seem to actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>change anythign when I run.  Something else for me to look at on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>my return.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dunno - I've done a complete update (I move the old trunk to one side now
</I>&gt;<i> and again after I've committed) and seems okay.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Try opening up the cross references view and see if the dummy
</I>&gt;<i> de.berlios.rcpviewer.progmodel.standard.aspects.Customer class (in
</I>&gt;<i> ...domain.runtime) is annotated with at all.  So far as the gui.acme plugin
</I>&gt;<i> is concerned, all I had to do in the end was to expose the classes to the
</I>&gt;<i> aspect: Project &gt; Properties &gt; AspectJ Aspect Path &gt; Libraries &gt; Add Class
</I>&gt;<i> Folder &gt; de.berlios.rcpviewer.domain.runtime/bin.  This info doesn't seem to
</I>&gt;<i> get put into the manifest, I guess its in .project?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Last thing: since there was that issue a while back regarding extension
</I>&gt;<i> point metadata being cached, I now have my run configuration to always flush
</I>&gt;<i> the runtime workspace.  Perhaps that's worth a try?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And last last thing: you could also try enabling the trace aspect to see if
</I>&gt;<i> that gives you any joy (either directly against the ...aspects.Customer as
</I>&gt;<i> (a) regular project, (b) plugin project, then same again against the
</I>&gt;<i> ...gui.acme classes).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'll sort out the aspcet stuff - I have not really looked very hard now.
Any lessons learnt I'll add to the wiki ... if I can rememeber where to 
go ... ;-)

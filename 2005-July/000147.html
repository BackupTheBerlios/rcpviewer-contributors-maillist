&gt;<i> -----Original Message-----
</I>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/rcpviewer-contributors">rcpviewer-contributors-admin at berlios.de</A>
</I>&gt;<i> [mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/rcpviewer-contributors">rcpviewer-contributors-admin at berlios.de</A>]On Behalf Of Mike Evans
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Rcpviewer-contributors] progress 20050711
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  From Dan's comments below, I realise that GUI 'liveness' (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> automagically reflecting all changes to the domain objects) is going to
</I>&gt;<i> be fun indeed.  Perhaps we'll need a global repository of all gui
</I>&gt;<i> elements tied to each object / attribute rather than the simpler
</I>&gt;<i> encapsulated listener model I was trying to go for.  Ah well.
</I>
I've been making good progress with my aspect approach - can correctly pick
up the pojos and detect changes to them.  Should be able to check in
something in the day or two.

What that means (I hope) is that the listener model ought to work ok.  The
aspect will collate the changes and will then ask the IDomainObject to
notify its listeners just for the bits of it that have changed.  So I think
there won't be any need for a global repository.

(Separately, I do think that an IDomainObject should be able to return
IOperation objects that are themselves observable.  This is so that the UI
can listen as to whether the operation's OK button should be enabled or not
dependent on any IPrerequisites associated with the IOperation.  But that's
for the future...)


&gt;<i> As a start I have added an 'orrible global refresh action that knows all
</I>&gt;<i> about the different gui elements and hunts them down and refreshes them
</I>&gt;<i> (and hence requires loads of public refresh() methods everywhere).  It
</I>&gt;<i> is exactly the opposite of what I want to do but might provoke thought
</I>&gt;<i> on what a better solution might look like.
</I>
I suspect it'll never get taken out...  but then again belt and braces is
sometimes best.


&gt;<i> Other than that, little functional change today - have been preparing
</I>&gt;<i> the ground for a non-modal 'ActionArgumentDialog' linked to the
</I>&gt;<i> ActionsView to be started tomorrow.
</I>
Glad to see its non-modal!  Hopefully a future version will be able to get
rid of the dialog and just put the parameters inline with the action view,
cf Windows Explorer action bar.  But as usual I'm talking about running
before we can walk.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh - and if you you do a 'Type Hierarchy' on UIJob you might get an
</I>&gt;<i> inkling of how I intend to use Job Families for clever(ish) undo/redo.
</I>&gt;<i> More later on that.
</I>
Will give that a pass for the moment since I'm in the middle of my aspects.
However, we should decide whether jobs are a UI responsibility or a domain
responsibility.  My suspicion is that there's an element of both (especially
with the IOperation object I alluded to above).

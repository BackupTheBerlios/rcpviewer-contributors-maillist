<PRE>Actually Today taken up with Subclipse commit faff &amp; installing Eclipse 
3.1.  However over the weekend...

Large Changes to DefaultEditor Processing:
* It now uses Domain info rather than its own reflection
* IFieldBuilders is once again a simple contract, rather than having 
lots of implied requirements due to impls having to create managed 
parts.  Basically I wrapped all the managed form stuff into a generic 
FieldPart class which uses IFieldBuilder only for the gui generation.
* This required two sub-types - IField &amp; IFieldListener but I hope these 
are straight-forward enough.
* As all the update &amp; dirty state is now in one place the aforementioned 
FieldPart) and is tied to Job's, I can easily move on to job-based stuff 
(undo/redo manager, macros and test harness scripting stuff).
* However an implication of this is that the DefaultEditor is not quite 
as generic as it was.  In fact I have completly removed the 
IEditorContent factory stuff as it really does not fit.  I will 
re-introduce it at a later stage but probably in a different form - once 
I know how the DefauyltEditor implementttaion pans out.
* Finally, as IFieldBuilders are specific to DefaultEditor, having their 
factories in the GuiPlugin seemed like code leakage to me.  So all gui 
factories (well - the one  - as I have deleted the 
EditorContentBuilderFactory) are noe lazily instantiated statics on the 
DefaultEditor itself.

Keen to get on with Job-based functionality however, sigh, Dan the boss, 
wants the action view.  Dan - where was that screenshot of QuickBooks?

<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Big week this week as I go off to a shipyard to see whether Incremental 
gets the money to continue past September.  Hence I'll be doing no more 
on RcpViewer this week.

So progress - over the weekend.  In summary much faff - with 'faff' 
defined as little progress for much effort.  I knew I'd hate DnD.

DnD:
We now have DnD for DomainObjects which is 'type-safe' - e.g. you can't 
drop a EasyBean instance on an AnotherEasyBean field.  You can see this 
if you open the action arguments dialog for the Counter.increment( 
EasyBean bean1, AnotherEasyBean bean2) method, and drag instances from 
the session tree onto it.
The impl smells so I'd ask Ted to have a look; in particular:

DnD Serialisation:
DnD should work by converting the dragged objects to platform bytes and 
converting back.  This is how all the primitive xxxTransfer classes in 
the dnd package work.  However IDomainObject's, and the pojo's they wrap 
are not necessarily serializable.  Hence I cannot use the standard 
approach of serialising/deserialising to/from byte arrays.
Moreover, with our intention to have a 'live' gui that automagically 
picks up changes to domain objects, we really do not want multiple 
instances relating to the same domain pojo.
Hence instead my DomainObjectTransfer class simply records the 
IDomainObject reference and 'emulates' all the to/from platform bytes 
stuff.  This is a hack.
I think better would be to use an id/proxy object that can be 
serialised/deserialised and on the drop operation allows us to obtain 
the appropriate IDomainObject from the session.  Any thoughts as to 
this?  Do you need some sort of key for objects in the session for any 
other purpose?

Other Stuff: LabelProvider
I have added an additional extension point (IDomainObjectLabelProvider) 
to allow users to specialise the display text and icon for instances of 
particular IDomainClass's.  This is used by the DefaultEditor, 
FieldBuilders etc.
Field builder and label provider factories are back in the base gui 
package as I take any opportunity I can to decrease scope of objects. 
Sorry for all this package juggling.  Just to confuse SVN...

AAAARGGHH! Stuff : SVN
... which brings me to SVN.
I have attached a screenshot of the error(s) I get everytime I try to 
sync the ...gui project. Any ideas?
Hence I had to sync / commit at (almost) file level this time.  I think 
everything is OK.  Let me know if you have any problems.  When i get 
back, I'll export the project afresh from the repository to see if this 
gets rid of my problems.


Finally: AspectJ
Dan - Though I have AspectJ in and the ...acme and ...runtime.domain 
projects dutifully have aspectJ natures, it does not seem to actually 
change anythign when I run.  Something else for me to look at on my return.
